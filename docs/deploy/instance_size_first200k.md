### DCO on Separate Instance Analysis

Running the DCO on a separate instance could potentially allow for reducing the size of the LedgerSpace instance. Here's an analysis of this approach:

1. **Separate DCO Instance**:
   - Instance Type: r5.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 128 GB RAM)
   - Usage: Approximately 10 minutes per day
   - Monthly Cost: $15 (based on on-demand pricing for 5 hours of usage per month)

2. **Reduced LedgerSpace Instance**:
   - Current: r5.12xlarge ($4,200/month)
   - Potential Reduction: r5.8xlarge ($2,800/month)
   - Monthly Savings: $1,400

3. **Net Impact**:
   - Additional Cost (DCO Instance): $15
   - Potential Savings (LedgerSpace Reduction): $1,400
   - Net Monthly Savings: $1,385

**Considerations**:
- The separate DCO instance would need to be initialized and ready for operation at midnight UTC each day.
- The instance can be turned off after the DCO process completes to save costs.
- The reduced LedgerSpace instance should still be capable of handling regular transaction loads and queries efficiently.

**Recommendation**:
Based on this analysis, moving the DCO to a separate instance that is turned on only when needed could significantly reduce overall costs while improving system performance. This approach allows for efficient use of resources by only running the DCO instance for the short time it's needed each day. However, it's crucial to:
1. Implement robust automation for starting and stopping the DCO instance.
2. Ensure data synchronization processes are efficient and reliable.
3. Thoroughly test this setup to ensure it meets performance requirements and doesn't introduce unacceptable complexity or data consistency issues.
4. Monitor the actual runtime of the DCO process and adjust the instance type if necessary to ensure it completes within the allocated time.
