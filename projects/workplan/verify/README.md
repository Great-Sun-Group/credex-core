# ID Verification Project Implementation Plan

## Overview
This project implements a member photo ID verification system using AWS Rekognition for Zimbabwe-based WhatsApp users. The implementation is broken down into discrete tasks that can be executed independently in sequence.

## Branch Structure
- Main project branch: `verify-project`
- Individual task branches: Created from `verify-project` for each task
- Naming convention: `verify-{task-number}-{short-description}`

## Task Organization
Each task is designed to be:
- Self-contained and independently executable
- Completable within a single AI conversation context
- Documented with clear acceptance criteria
- Testable with specific test cases
- Mergeable back to the project branch
