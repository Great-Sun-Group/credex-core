# Neo4j License Management and Deployment Workplan

## Current Situation
- We have implemented Neo4j Enterprise Startup Edition license management across development, staging, and production environments.
- The deployment process has been updated to use the license efficiently and in compliance with its terms.
- Security groups have been updated to improve network isolation and access control.
- Automated tests for license validation and network security have been implemented and integrated into the deployment workflow.

## Completed Objectives
1. Efficiently use the Neo4j Enterprise Startup Edition license across all environments.
2. Ensure compliance with license terms.
3. Implement a scalable and maintainable deployment strategy.
4. Improve network security and isolation for Neo4j instances.
5. Implement automated testing for license validation and network security.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. License Allocation (Completed)
- [x] Production: 2 instances (1 ledger, 1 search)
- [x] Staging: 1 instance (combined ledger and search)
- [x] Development: Up to 6 instances as needed

### 2. Update Terraform Configuration (Completed)
- [x] Update `terraform/neo4j.tf` to use Neo4j Enterprise Edition
- [x] Implement variable instance counts for each environment
- [x] Configure instance types to comply with license restrictions
- [x] Implement separate security groups for each environment
- [x] Configure granular ingress rules for Neo4j ports
- [x] Implement network isolation for non-production environments

### 3. Secure License Management (Completed)
- [x] Set up GitHub Secrets for storing the Neo4j Enterprise license
- [x] Implement secure retrieval of license key in deployment scripts

### 4. Deployment Script Updates (Completed)
- [x] Modify `.github/workflows/deploy-development.yml` to handle Neo4j Enterprise license
- [x] Implement environment-specific configurations

### 5. Documentation (Completed)
- [x] Create `docs/neo4j_license_management.md` for license management procedures
- [x] Create `docs/neo4j_monitoring.md` for monitoring and maintenance procedures
- [x] Create `docs/neo4j_deployment.md` for overall deployment and management guide
- [x] Update `docs/testing/neo4j_license_validation.md` with test cases

### 6. Testing and Validation (Completed)
- [x] Implement automated test cases for each environment
- [x] Create `tests/neo4j_validation.sh` for license compliance and network security tests
- [x] Integrate automated tests into the GitHub Actions workflow

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up AWS CloudWatch alarms for Neo4j instances
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Configure alerts for license expiration
- [ ] Implement and test backup and restore procedures

### 2. Final Review and Sign-off
- [ ] Conduct a final review of all implemented changes
- [ ] Obtain sign-off from relevant stakeholders
- [ ] Schedule regular reviews of the Neo4j deployment and license management processes

## Next Steps
1. Set up and configure monitoring tools as outlined in `docs/neo4j_monitoring.md`
2. Implement backup and restore procedures
3. Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire Neo4j deployment process
4. Prepare for final review and sign-off

This workplan will be updated as we progress and if new requirements or challenges arise.
