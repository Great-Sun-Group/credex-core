      <h1>Credex-Core Software License</h1>

      <p>
        You are welcome to explore, experiment with, and build upon this work
        within the three purposes and one exclusion below. If you fork this
        project or create something new based on this codebase, this license
        will automatically apply to all such work.
      </p>

      <h3>
        1. Development and testing of apps connecting to the credex-core API
      </h3>
      <p>
        You are invited to use this codebase to run credex-core development
        servers so that you can develop apps that integrate with the live credex
        ecosystem. Any app built while using this codebase for development and
        testing remains solely the property of its developer(s) without
        limitation or restriction, including charging for their services at
        their own discretion, provided that all underlying data remains in the
        possession of the member, stored in their credex account.
      </p>
      <p>
        If necessary, an "App Store" type registration and code review process
        may be put in place for developers so that members will know they can
        trust 3rd party software. This review process will be free, minimal, and
        prompt. Its only purpose will be to ensure that member's data is being
        handled securely and stored appropriately. Currently a CLIENT_API_KEY is
        required to access the login endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should any updates to the ecosystem codebase itself be required to
        facilitate the operation of a third-party app, requests will be
        welcomed.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Economic research and modeling</h3>

      <p>
        The credex-core software and connected neo4j databases have the power to
        model economic activity and circulation of value with 100% precision
        across large-scale networks of members and accounts. The scale at which
        it can model, and the associated computational costs, will soon be
        determined as we implement automated testing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The use of this codebase for economic modeling is welcomed. Additions to
        the codebase that enhance its modeling capacity are also welcomed,
        provided they do not impact security. Forks from this codebase that
        reduce security in order to increase modeling ease or capacity are
        permitted, provided they are shared publicly under these license terms.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Development and testing of the credex-core API itself</h3>

      <p>
        Contributions, bug fixes, and security testing and patches are welcome.
        If you'd like to collaborate or contribute, please get in touch.
      </p>

      <h3>4. EXCLUSION: Live ledger</h3>

      <p>
        You do not have permission to use this software to track real
        outstanding debts. You may not deploy this software to be used by real
        users transacting at arms length from each other. Data of real past
        transactions may be used, but only as modeling, testing, or research
        input. If you want to transact real value with credex, you are invited
        to use the live shared ledger of the credex ecosystem at mycredex.app,
        and to develop apps that connect your users to their credex accounts as
        outlined in the welcomed uses above.
      </p>

      <h2>Licensing Summary</h2>

      <p>
        This customized licensing approach ensures the integrity and unity of
        the credex ecosystem as a shared economic network that all can access
        and benefit from, while still encouraging community engagement and
        experimentation, enabling economic research, and empowering the
        development of interdependent software ecosystems that retain the option
        to self-fund and charge for their own software in whatever way they
        choose.
