      <h2>Sovereignty and association</h2>
      <p>
        As sovereign humans, we have the power to enter into any type of mutually agreeable relationship with other humans. The credex ecosystem enables humans to create corporate entities on their own or with each other, each with their own corporate balance sheets and customizable ownership structures, all with access to the shared ledger for the use of customizable smart contracts and data storage. Corporations, institutions, partnerships, cooperatives, trusts, foundations, nonprofits, charities, and every other form of organization and many more yet to be tried can be established and enabled to transact within the credex ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we humans come together with shared purpose, and organize ourselves to achieve that purpose, we are incredibly powerful. The innovation of the corporation enables humans to organize themselves in powerful and freely-chosen ways. Economically, the innovation of the corporate model enables multiple investors to bring capital to the same project.
      </p>
      <p>
        But while humans are sovereign, corporate entities are not. Corporate entities are groups of sovereign humans, bound in specific contractual relationships regarding specific purposes, assets, and activities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Limited corporations</h2>
      <p>
        The limited liability corporation is an innovation of the corporate model that protects investors from losing anything more than their investment. If a limited corporation creates liabilities greater than its assets, then becomes insolvent, it goes under owing value to creditors. However, the owners of this limited liability corporation are not personally accountable for those debts or damages. Owners and investors can lose everything they have invested in the limited corporation, but beyond that level they are isolated from responsibility for (legitimate and legal) corporate actions and decisions, even though as owners they bear ultimate responsibility for those decisions, and receive all of the profit these decisions may have created.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limited corporation limits downside risk for investors. Viewed through the lens of human sovereignty, groups of individual humans are ultimately responsible for the actions of every human organization, and allowing corporations to create a shield between actions and consequences runs counter to core ecosystem principles. Limiting the liability of humans for their own decisions just means that the liabilities end up somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limited liability corporations prevail across the global economy because, like fiat money, limited liability is a competitive advantage in an economically empty world. Limited liability corporations artificially decrease risk for investors. This artificially increases the availability of investment capital. In an economically empty world, this increased capital can usually be put to positive economic use to generate real return. However, in a full world, this artificial altering of natural consequences to generate growth becomes a systemically negative force. When these artificially increased levels of capital are run through the debt-based multipliers of the fiat money system, it forms a potent engine for growth and expansion. This engine powered successful economies for generations, but it becomes uncompetitive in an economically full world.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The cost of limited liability</h2>
      <p>
        The principle of a limited corporation is also fundamentally at odds with the principle of full cost accounting. Where real costs exist, they must be borne by those whose decisions created those costs, especially when the decision makers profit or could profit from their decisions. The limited corporation incentivizes and enables the externalizing of costs onto other humans and onto the natural world.
      </p>
      <p>
        What a limited corporation sees as externalized costs are always real costs somewhere. In an economically empty world, even if the costs of these externalities are terrible, the economic system remains stable because the costs are mostly borne outside that system. In an economically empty world, externalities to corporations often remain external to the whole economy. But in an economically full world, what is an externality to one corporation (and its owners) quickly becomes a cost to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        A factory may treat toxic sludge as an externality and dump it in the harbour, but to the fisheries and tourism industry, the cost is direct and obvious. In an economically empty world, the easiest solution may be to build the factory somewhere else, but in an economically full world, there is nowhere else to build it. The costs will quickly be borne somewhere, and it's only fair that they be borne by the owners of the factory who will profit off its activities. If those activities then become unprofitable, that's just the free market at work. The boundaries of sustainability, freedom, and sovereignty trump the right to profit. Such profit exists outside the organic economy.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Unlimited corporations</h2>
      <p>
        All corporate entities (limited and unlimited) can issue and accept credexes. However, the owners of unlimited corporations are held personally responsible for the promises their unlimited corporations make. This means that should demurrage occur in an unlimited corporate account, it will be reflected accurately for what it is in the personal account history of the owners, to the degree that they each bore ownership and profited (or could potentially have profited) from the activities of the corporation, or were responsible for its governance. Unlimited corporations transfer their liabilities up the chain to the humans who are always behind the corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any type of corporate entity can transact exactly like a sovereign human, but unlimited corporations do not bear ultimate responsibility for their actions, specific humans (owners) always bear responsibility for legitimately made corporate decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unlimited corporation keeps corporate power loyal to human sovereignty, and keeps flows of invested capital focused directly on solving the real problems faced by humans, at the lowest possible cost.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When rights collide</h2>
      <p>
        If sovereign humans have the right to cooperate in any way they desire, and they desire limited liability corporations, yet these corporations are formed in a way that creates unhealthy systemic impacts and therefore impacts the rights and interests of allâ€¦ how do we proceed?
      </p>
      <p>
        There may come a time at which the systemic impact of limited liability is widely recognized to the point where such corporations would be disabled from transacting by force of law. However, because this infringes on the rights of humans to associate, it should only be done through democratic process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until such time as democratic process forbids limited liability, the credex ecosystem will relate to this issue with certification and badges. Limited corporations, which are perhaps an even more intrinsic part of our modern life than money itself, are welcomed in the credex ecosystem. They are simply identified as what they are, as are their unlimited corporate cousins.
      </p>
      <p>
        A limited corporation operating in any jurisdiction can register as an unlimited or limited corporation within the credex ecosystem. Specific human beings are always liable for the ecosystem liabilities of unlimited corporations. Limited corporations in the credex ecosystem, like everywhere else, operate without this personal accountability. The credex ecosystem is intended to reflect legal reality, and give options such as unlimited corporations for those who desire to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our work is to align our personal actions with our values. Limited corporations are part of the fabric of our society, and intimately connected to the personal actions of all of us through our purchase decisions, and through corporations we ourselves own or invest in. Our strategy is to understand the truth of the situation, and adjust our own actions appropriately. It doesn't help anyone to go to war against the real world. Limited liability is not an enemy, it is a dynamic of reality to be worked with.
      </p>

      <h2>Money integration</h2>
      <p>
        Money is also not an enemy. A financial institution (limited or unlimited) can be certified to open audited ecosystem asset accounts of any kind (currency, precious metal, bond, equity, crypto, etc) in the ecosystem. These audited and secured accounts enable them to create and sell financial products that their customers can use to integrate their money assets with their ecosystem assets, and smoothly transfer value between the credex ecosystem and money economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        These critical functions enable the smooth adoption and deployment of the ecosystem on behalf of members.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Building the structure</h2>
      <p>
        Through the flexible power of denominations and certifications, credexes put the tools of global-scale financial institutions into the hands of anyone who wants to use them. The ease of credex enables complex global transactions and multi-party chains of multi-denominational liabilities with a few clicks, while keeping risk localized and full costs accounted for, at zero cost for transaction-level functionality, and efficient market-driven rates rising from that zero baseline for smart-contracted functions involving accumulations of capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem offers incredible efficiencies for existing financial institutions, and opens up entirely new possibilities for financial innovation and wealth creation, with feet firmly planted in a moral stand where wealth generation truly is positive for humanity and biosphere, as well as for those who end up profiting directly from investments and risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mapping the capabilities and capacities of the ecosystem onto existing financial products and models such as bonds, equities, derivatives, funds, indexes, hedges, options, and the whole financial universe is a task for the free market, within the boundaries of human sovereignty. Financial institutions, fintech, banking, challenger banking, crypto developers, and anyone who wants to build mutual wealth in this environment or integrate their products with it in any way can get to work.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Accounting integration</h2>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem integrates seamlessly into existing accounting practices and protocols. The complexity of this integration depends on the ways you use your credex account, and on your regulatory reporting requirements. Because the credex ecosystem is a natively multi-denominational environment, the requirements of single-denomination reporting can add layers of complexity, which can be implemented as required.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you treat your credex account like a bank account and only transact in your base denomination, it can be accounted for using the same standard accrual accounting techniques that would normally be used for a cash bank account. If a demurrage occurs in this scenario, it requires a single entry to a demurrage account (like bad debt), and the accounts will balance. The daily DCO multi-denominational adjustments will have zero impact on your accounts. This accounting treatment legitimately treats credexes like money, because they behave that way from a single-denomination accounting perspective, with the exception of demurrage entries.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use your credex account exclusively like a bank account, you can treat it like money because relative to money it is only contingent on the performance of your counterparty, and that can be accounted for with a single demurrage entry if they fail to provide the promised value.
      </p>

      <h3>Multi-denominational accounting</h3>
      <p>
        If your multi-denominational needs are simple and you only utilize relatively stable denominations, each denomination in your credex account can be mapped to a bank account of a different currency denomination in your accounting software. This takes advantage of modern accounting automation, but only goes a few steps further in describing the power of your credex account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limiting your credex account to currency denominations closes your access to credcoin, and to some of the most potent investment and funding tools and opportunities available within the ecosystem. Your credex account provides a level of data and wealth-generating capacity that money economies cannot match. If you want to generate wealth in multi-denominational transactions, investments, and capital flows, your single-denomination accounting software will necessarily become a secondary, though still fully meaningful, reference point.
      </p>

      <h3>Advanced accounting</h3>
      <p>
        When you expand to multi-currency transacting while you still need to meet the requirements of single-currency reporting, the most precise accounting option is for credexes to enter your balance sheet as they clear in credloops. While a credex denominated in anything other than your base denomination is outstanding, its value is contingent on fluctuations in that denomination's value vs your base denomination, as well as being contingent on your counterparty's ability to deliver value. But at the moment a credloop is found and cleared, each payable in any denomination can be associated with a specific receivable in any denomination at a specific moment in time, and both can be translated into your base currency as of that moment as an entry crediting and debiting the appropriate two accounts (cash and income or expense at the transaction level) by the converted amount of the cleared credloop.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way we can translate multi-denominational transacting into single-denomination reporting by using multiple entries, likely across multiple accounts, to reflect a single transaction. The ecosystem is a network, and with these multiple entries we express each transaction as a function of its relationships as they flow across your full balance sheet, without the abstraction that money both provides and requires by injecting the intermediary of a bank or other third party account. The downside of this approach is time-lag and risk-blindness. This kind of reporting excludes credexes that have been issued but not redeemed.
      </p>

      <h3>Regulatory compliance</h3>
      <p>
        The exclusion of outstanding credexes of relatively unstable denominations from financial reporting (except as footnotes when material) is GAAP-compliant. What this means is that credexes give the power of off-balance sheet assets and liabilities to all. Should regulatory authorities demand that off-balance sheet assets and liabilities be disclosed at a more granular level, when they apply those regulations, ecosystem members and corporations can easily export a report that can be audited down to the most granular level as of any given moment, and any given set of risk assumptions applied for stress-testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across-the-board disclosure and audit of off-balance sheet assets and liabilities is likely to expose rot in asset money systems, due to their misalignment with underlying economic realities. It would also require a massive amount of complex analysis on an ongoing basis. But operating in the credex ecosystem, sovereign humans and their corporate representatives have nothing to fear from disclosure of these contingent assets and liabilities, which are being updated in dynamic relationship to each other in the ecosystem every minute (credloops) and every 24 hours (denominations in the DCO), and are built on stable and auditable trust that can always be granularly traced back to specific other sovereign humans or limited corporations, given privacy constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        As members, this is information that we ourselves may want to access for our own automated risk analysis at the most granular and current level possible, under multiple future scenarios. Unleashing the free market on such stress-testing capacities, based on the kind of thorough, connected, private, and secure data that the ecosystem provides to members and corporations, and giving specific sovereign humans ultimate responsibility for all economic decisions, makes regulatory compliance trivial for members, and in many cases even automatic.
      </p>

      <h3>Daily adjustments</h3>
      <p>
        Should your regulatory authority or your own needs require full and current single-denomination disclosure of every contingent asset and liability across all denominations, the accounting link between your ecosystem account and your single-denominational reporting can be upgraded with daily adjusting entries to capture the dynamic multi-denominational reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most detailed possible way to track fluctuations in the relative values of denominations within the restrictions of single-denomination accounting is for the credex to enter your balance sheet the moment it is created, and add an adjusting entry every day to track the fluctuation in value of the outstanding portion of each credex. This adjusting entry would be made on each side of the general ledger entry that each outstanding transaction impacts. This outstanding portion could also be risk-adjusted and stress-tested, dynamically and granularly as desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credlooped portions of a transaction can always be locked to GAAP-compliant single-denomination values, which need no further adjustments.
