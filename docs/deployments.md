# Deployment Documentation

This file has been split into two separate documents to better serve different audiences:

1. [Developer Deployment Guide](developer_deployments.md)
   - For developers working on the credex-core application
   - Covers local development and GitHub Codespaces environments
   - Includes setup instructions, configuration details, and development processes

2. [Deployer's Guide for Staging and Production](deployer_deployments.md)
   - For team members responsible for deploying and managing the application in staging and production environments
   - Covers AWS infrastructure, Terraform management, and deployment processes
   - Includes configuration details, monitoring, and security considerations

Please refer to the appropriate document based on your role and needs. If you require information from both documents, feel free to consult both guides.

For any questions or issues related to the deployment process, please contact the DevOps team.
