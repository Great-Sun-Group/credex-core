const MORE_ABOUT_CREDEX = `Today credex is being used for combi rides in Harare. Credex solves the problem of small
change. Riders charge their credex account with USD at a verified agent, and then use that
charge in any amount to pay for one ride at a time. When a combi accepts your credex, your
charge is transferred to their account, and they can cash it out at a registered agent.
There is no fee to charge your account, or to use that charge to pay for goods and services.
Combi drivers and owners can use the charge theyâ€™ve received to purchase goods and services
within the credex ecosystem, also at no charge. When an account charge is cashed out at a
registered agent, there is a 2% fee.`;
