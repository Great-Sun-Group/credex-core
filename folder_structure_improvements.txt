3. Organize source code:
   Inside the 'src' folder:
   a. Create an 'api' folder to group all API-related code
   b. Move Account, Avatar, Credex, DevAdmin, and Member folders into the 'api' folder
   c. Keep the Core folder outside of the 'api' folder

5. Group common utilities:
   - Create a 'utils' folder inside 'src' for common utility functions

6. Separate test files:
   - Create a 'tests' folder at the root level, mirroring the 'src' folder structure

Proposed New Structure:

├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── Account/
│   │   ├── Avatar/
│   │   ├── Credex/
│   │   ├── DevAdmin/
│   │   └── Member/
│   ├── Core/
│   └── utils/
├── tests/
├── compose.yaml
├── Dockerfile
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── update_combined_code.sh

Implementation Notes:
1. Move files and folders according to the new structure
2. Update import statements in your code to reflect new file locations
3. Update build and run scripts to work with the new folder structure
4. Ensure all developers are aware of the new structure

Benefits:
- Better organization of configuration files
- Clear separation of documentation
- Grouped API-related code
- Consistent naming conventions
- Dedicated space for common utilities
- Separate area for tests
- Enhanced clarity and easier navigation for developers
