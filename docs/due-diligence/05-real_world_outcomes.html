    <h1 class="chapter-title">Real World Outcomes</h1>

    <h2>1. Organizing and incentivising the distributed production of economic value</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The credex ecosystem enables low friction value creating exchange of real goods and services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Building economic resilience because modern money is systemically vulnerable to existing and looming changes in its environment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The credex ecosystem enables transactions independent of modern money and money systems, yet integrated seamlessly with them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Financially aligning an economic network to produce maximum value within evolving limits of sustainability</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The credex ecosystem and the daily credcoin offering will bring market dynamics and the full power of capital to bear on the challenge of aligning an economic network within the limits of sustainability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Building widespread multigenerational wealth</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The credex ecosystem enables widespread accumulation of real and financial capital across a network of economic nodes.</li>
        <li>The credex ecosystem enables low friction transactions and value creating loops of exchange to build this capital.</li>
        <li>The credex ecosystem is a financial network that can stably operate within the limits of ecological sustainability, and therefore endure for the long term.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Empowering human sovereignty</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The credex ecosystem empowers all of its members with the daily right to consume natural resources at sustainable levels, and provides a voluntary and business friendly mechanism to implement this in a way that moves our economic network towards wealth generating alignment with the biosphere.</li>
        <li>The credex ecosystem empowers all members to create their own medium of exchange, and control its value by the provision (or lack thereof) of real value as contracted.</li>
        <li>The credex ecosystem offers all of its members the power to own their own data and share it on their own terms only. (This right is currently enforced only programmatically, with cryptographic enforcement to be implemented with the future development of web3 infrastructure.)</li>
    </ul>
