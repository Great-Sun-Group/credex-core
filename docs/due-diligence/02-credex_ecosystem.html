    <h1 class="chapter-title">The Credex Ecosystem</h1>

    <h2>What is the credex ecosystem?</h2>

    <p>
      A credex is a payment by smart contract. If I owe you and you owe me, we
      can offset our debts against each other and cancel them without money
      changing hands. If I owe you, you owe Alice, and Alice owes me, we can
      offset these debts against each other and cancel them, without money
      changing hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem implements this principle at scale seamlessly across
      all currency denominations, asset classes, and derivatives using low
      friction smart contracts to enable moneyless payments, commerce, and
      finance.
    </p>

    <h2>The credex ecosystem solves the problems identified:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Organizing and incentivising the distributed production of economic
        value
      </li>
      <li>
        Building economic resilience because modern money is systemically
        vulnerable to existing and looming changes in its environment
      </li>
      <li>
        Financially aligning an economic network to produce maximum value within
        evolving limits of sustainability
      </li>
      <li>Building widespread multigenerational wealth</li>
      <li>Empowering human sovereignty</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The credex ecosystem is a digital space that enables:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transaction contracts anchored to government fiat, denominated in
        currency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transaction contracts anchored to the value of specific assets,
        denominated in anything with a verifiable market price (commodity, bond,
        equity, etc).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transaction contracts anchored to any formula based value structure,
        derivative, combination, average, conditional statement, etc. The credex
        ecosystem puts the full flexibility and power of programmatic smart
        contracts at the fingertips of every producer, trader, investor and
        consumer, with freedom for developers and service providers to build
        their own smart contracts within the rules of the ecosystem and link
        them to digital, financial, and real assets (protocols under
        development).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transaction contracts anchored to the real wealth entering the organic
        economy today, denominated in CXX.
      </li>
      <li>
        Secure web3 digital identity management, with native permission
        structures for storing and securely sharing data of any kind (protocols
        under development).
      </li>
      <li>
        Opportunity for voluntary participation in the daily credcoin offering
        (DCO) to help us orient the production, exchange and consumption of
        value within the network towards sustainability and mutual sovereignty.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Like money, credex scales the barter-based principle of value creating
      exchange across time and space, and to multiple participants. Unlike
      money, the credex ecosystem achieves this result without leverage or
      abstraction. Credex preserves the strengths of barter and minimizes its
      weaknesses, and credex also preserves the strengths of money and minimizes
      its weaknesses.
    </p>

    <h2>Smart contract</h2>

    <p>
      A credex is a smart contract for one member to provide a specified amount
      of value to another member, within a specified amount of time. Expressed
      in English, the credex contract template is:
    </p>

    <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0">
      &lt;member1&gt; promises to provide &lt;member2&gt; with
      &lt;amount/formula&gt; &lt;denomination/formula&gt;<br />
      worth of value by &lt;date&gt;.
    </div>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <pre>
Alice promises to provide Bob with $10.00 CAD
worth of value by June 22, 2023.

Alice promises to provide Bob with 0.001 BTC
worth of value by June 22, 2023.

Alice promises to provide Bob with 0.022 XAU
worth of value by June 22, 2023.

Alice promises to provide Bob with 1 share of Acme Inc.
worth of value by June 22, 2023.

Alice promises to provide Bob with the difference in value
between 1 barrel of Brent crude and $100 USD on market close on June 22, 2023 
worth of value by June 25, 2023.
    </pre>

    <p>
      These smart contracts replace money as a placeholder for value received
      but not yet provided, and provided but not yet received. They replace
      money completely, because even if a credex is denominated in CAD, no
      Canadian dollars are ever required to fulfill the contract, and the
      contract is not enforceable by the provision of CAD, except at the
      discretion of the acceptor of the credex. The promise is to provide a
      specific measure of value. The contract is specifically for the value, not
      the money which measures it.
    </p>

    <h3>The ecosystem in action</h3>

    <p>
      If Alice provides Bob with a widget, Bob provides Charlie a blidget, and
      Charlie provides Alice a tridget, each worth $10, and they pay each other
      with credex smart contracts, the contracts will find this loop when the
      last transaction is completed, and will mark each contract as fully
      redeemed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this way, value is created for all participants in a credloop. They
      each get what they want. Each credex will be part of multiple credloops
      until it is fully redeemed. Credexes are automatically redeemed across
      denominations (and asset classes, derivatives and formulas) with daily
      market rates.
    </p>

    <h3>Leverage of existing assets</h3>

    <p>
      A credex can be integrated with money or other assets, effectively
      leveraging them into additional value. This puts the same leveraged-based
      money creation impulse used by banks and shadow banks in the modern money
      system at the fingertips of every member, while keeping any default risks
      localized to that member and their counterparties. Such smart contracts
      might look like:
    </p>

    <pre>
Alice promises to provide Bob with <strong>$10.00 CAD</strong>
worth of value by June 25, 2023
<strong>and any portion of this value not provided by
midnight UTC on the above date will be
debited from her CAD security account and
credited to Bob's.</strong>

Alice promises to provide Bob with <strong>the difference in value in CAD</strong>
<strong>between 1 barrel of Brent crude and $100 USD on market close on June 22, 2023</strong>
worth of value by June 25, 2023
<strong>and 63.25% of any of this value not provided by midnight UTC on
the above date will be sold from her US1Y (US Treasuries)
security account and the proceeds deposited to Bob's EUR account.</strong>
(the purpose here being one way of specifically and easily sharing a specific amount of default risk and enabling a specific amount of leverage between counterparties)
    </pre>

    <h2>Credex vs money</h2>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem alleviates our need for money by offering an
      alternate medium of exchange: specific value creating smart contracts,
      between specific economic participants, linked together in specific
      credloops.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike money, credex does not have a limited supply, is highly
      decentralized, has high degrees of transparency while maintaining privacy,
      empowers the sovereignty of every member, is created to serve the
      counterparties involved directly rather than for the profit of a financial
      institution, provides near zero friction payment processing across all
      currency denominations, financial asset classes, commodities,
      cryptocurrencies, derivatives and formulas, is concrete and specific
      rather than abstract, and is far more adaptable to a full world. Credex is
      like money, but better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where money is fungible and abstract, credexes are non-transferable and
      specific. A credex is a non-transferable smart contract between two
      economic participants. When I receive a credex, I can't spend it. I issue
      a new credex every time I spend, and accept a new credex every time I get
      paid. The credex ecosystem clears my expenses against my income in
      credloops of mutual value exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money will purchase the same value for anyone who holds it, credex will
      not. An outstanding credex holds value only to the economic participant
      who accepted it, and its value is entirely dependent on the economic
      participant who issued it and the paths that can be found to provide the
      value from the issuer to the acceptor. A credex is a placeholder that only
      holds potential value to a specific acceptor node until that value has
      been provided to the acceptor in actuality by that specific issuer node
      via one or more specific credloops.
    </p>

    <h3>Abstraction VS trusted specificity</h3>

    <p>
      A credex is a promise to provide value to a counterparty in the future. An
      outstanding credex represents an imbalance between value provided/promised
      and value received. A redeemed credex represents a balance between value
      promised and value received.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every outstanding credex has an embedded default risk associated with a
      specific economic participant. Therefore, even when two credexes have the
      same face value, the unique credit risk associated with each credex and
      the inability of participants to exchange or transfer credexes
      differentiates credex from money.
    </p>

    <p>
      The specificity of credex differentiates it from money even further. Even
      if two credexes have the same face value, and were issued and redeemed on
      the same days so no longer bear default risk, they are still not
      equivalent like the money version of that transaction would be. With
      credex, an economic participant can see which payables were cleared
      against which receivables, so can know specifically the multiple values
      that were provided and received in every completed transaction. Money as a
      placeholder endures in a way that disconnects it from its origin (which
      for modern money is in the capital leveraging process) and therefore money
      can only give us an abstract and time-limited currency equivalence of
      goods and services. Credex is different because it only holds a place
      (debt/credit) until the specific values in the contract have been
      delivered, and from that moment exists only as a record of that exchange
      of specific values (goods/services) and the way that value was
      delivered/redeemed along specific credloop paths.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the issuer of a credex fails to provide the contracted value to the
      acceptor, that default is tracked, and can be compiled into credit scores
      (with various degrees of cryptographically secured privacy and
      transparency to fit every situation) that future counterparties will
      surely request and require before transacting. If a member does not
      fulfill their promises, future counterparties will be cautious to
      transact. In this way credit risk is localized and becomes purely between
      nodes, with no need for central oversight or authorization.
    </p>

    <p>
      With these mechanisms, the credex ecosystem personalizes what the money
      economy abstracts. Credexes are issued and tracked in a distributed manner
      at the exact moments of value creating exchange. Credex is created as
      nodes take the specific risks they are comfortable to take in order to
      build mutual wealth in cooperation with specific counterparties.
      Counterparties are enabled to transact with each other frictionlessly to
      the degree that they trust each other, and tools such as credit ratings
      and security accounts are provided to help increase that mutual trust. A
      proliferation of these tools will be developed as the system evolves and
      matures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Default risks are kept local between counterparties, and are always
      limited only to outstanding credex balances. Redeemed credexes are a
      record of value already provided and received, and carry no default risk.
      The successful credex ecosystem will blaze a trail of value created across
      time and space for all participants. New outstanding balances will
      constantly be created, and these imbalances will lead the way toward
      mutual value creation, which will become realized one specific exchange at
      a time as the economy flows forward.
    </p>

    <h3>Limited supply VS unlimited availability</h3>

    <p>
      Money supply must be limited. Money is required for transactions, so
      limited money reduces opportunities for value creating exchange. Credex
      can be frictionlessly created anywhere and anytime that two economic
      participants trust in their ability to create mutual value.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Risk of systemic bankruptcy or currency destruction VS effortless credex
      balance
    </h3>

    <p>
      A money economy is always balancing somewhere on the scale of inflation to
      deflation. Spiraling deflation (lack of money) leads to systemic
      bankruptcy and spiraling inflation (excess of money) leads to currency
      destruction. These are simply non-issues in the credex ecosystem, where
      money supply cannot be a concern, because there is no money.
    </p>

    <h3>Centralized and opaque VS decentralized, transparent, and secure</h3>

    <p>
      Modern money requires hierarchical chains of authorizations and
      permissions cascading outwards from central money-creating authorities.
      Credex requires a single (member owned and not-for-profit) accounting
      intermediary to implement and manage a decentralized, transparent,
      auditable, privacy securing, individually empowering, contract creation
      and fulfillment process.
    </p>

    <h3>Created for third party profit VS created for first party value</h3>

    <p>
      Money is created by authorized and permitted institutions for the purpose
      of generating a profit. Credex is created by transacting members for the
      purpose of enabling a specific value creating exchange, and no third party
      extracts profit from the transaction. The risks are borne directly by the
      counterparties who are cooperating to create value. The motive to create
      credex is value first, profit second. With money it's profit first, value
      second.
    </p>

    <h3>Payment processing</h3>

    <p>
      Payment processing on the distributed ecosystem ledger opens the full
      payment and value tracking process to auditable innovation, automation,
      and simplification. Client apps can process payments with a
      few taps, and payment automations can be built into digital processes
      through API calls and other modern programming tools to streamline the
      tracking of payments and the value creation process across economic chains
      with incredible specificity, precision, and automation.
    </p>

    <h3>Money creation, interest and capital deployment</h3>

    <p>
      Credex is created when value is created. Money is created when capital is
      leveraged.
    </p>

    <p>
      Value creation and circulation is the primary economic activity. Capital
      accumulation occurs when circulating value collects with specific nodes in
      an economic network. Capital growth occurs when accumulated capital is
      invested in value producing economic activity. Value creation is the
      activity from which capital creation naturally arises. Value creation is
      highly distributed across an economic network, while capital creation
      occurs only in certain nodes in an economic network.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the credex ecosystem, as in any economic network with free exchange,
      capital will accumulate with certain nodes. This capital needs a growth
      outlet in the form of investments. Smart contracts that invest or loan
      accumulated capital behave differently in the credex ecosystem than
      transaction contracts that are associated directly with value creating
      exchange. These investment protocols are still under development and there
      will be many options to explore and implement (first modelled on equities,
      bonds, loans, derivatives, etc, and growing from there) but a key feature
      will be the provision of interest and return on investment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credex is created in a distributed manner without interest when value is
      created. All credexes are temporary and expiring
      placeholders that play a critical role in the ongoing free flow of the
      production and circulation of goods and services of real value, and the
      accumulation, investment, and growth of capital. The credex ecosystem
      offers customizable smart contracts for each stage of the financial
      process that can be directly linked with every stage of globally
      distributed or hyperlocal production processes. The ecosystem incorporates
      all currency denominations, asset classes, specific real and financial
      assets, derivatives and formulas, and most importantly the ongoing flows
      of value creation that sustain real wealth.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the money economies, money is created with interest when capital is
      leveraged. Created money in a sense disappears when the associated balance
      sheet liability is cleared, but the interest charged on that created money
      is never reversed out of the money system, and the assets are almost
      always quickly re-leveraged. This creates a constant debt overhang which
      propels the money economy forward. This propulsion embeds a potent bias
      for growth into money economies. These economies have evolutionarily
      optimized around this engine, which powered money effectively and
      powerfully in an empty world. Money excels and outcompetes in an empty
      world because of the growth impulse embedded in this overhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, a money economy cannot enable a truly free flow of value creation
      and circulation, because its embedded growth bias is a constraint on the
      network as a whole that influences the behaviour of nodes in the specific
      direction of individual competition for resources/money to fuel their
      financial growth. Competition and cooperation will always both be present
      in systems of free exchange. Systemic emphasis on competition-for-growth
      has been proven to succeed in an empty world. We believe that systemic
      emphasis on cooperation-for-preservation will work better in a full world,
      and money works against this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money is a scarce resource that must be competed for. Due to the debt
      overhang there is never quite enough money to fulfill all obligations,
      which puts constant pressure to compete for the scarce resource of money,
      which is the only thing that can be used to repay the portion of the debt
      overhang that is borne by each node in the network.
    </p>

    <p>
      The irony is that in a full world, a strategy of competition for capital
      growth is likely to be less successful than one of cooperation for the
      preservation of wealth generating assets and processes. It is the
      requirement for competitive growth that is hardwired into the debt
      overhang of money economies that may have been their greatest strength,
      and may be becoming their greatest weakness. The unfulfillable demand for
      growth is at the root of the weakness that leads to the instability that
      is building up in system-critical nodes of the money network.
    </p>

    <p>
      Capital follows real growth, wherever it leads. In a full world, money
      economies are poised to fail at delivering a rich growth environment for
      capital, and this failure of growth may ironically be due to their
      unwavering bias towards growth at all costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem offers a better, more accountable, freer, more data
      rich and customizable, lower friction environment for capital growth than
      money economies can offer. In a full world, we believe that capital
      deployed in the credex ecosystem will be more effective and create greater
      real returns than capital deployed in the growth dependent money
      economies.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the very deepest level, credex is more aligned to the purpose of
      organizing and incentivising the distributed production and circulation of
      economic value. Money creation is driven by capital growth and therefore
      requires it. Credex creation is driven by value creation, and therefore
      requires it. This tunes the ecosystem firstly to the needs of distributed
      value creation, and secondly to capital accumulation and growth. The
      credex ecosystem aligns with actual value creation processes and so it
      fades to the background as it enables the creation, circulation, and
      accumulation of real values, and the investment of accumulated capital.
      Credex freely offers and empowers growth in any direction, which is the
      environment in which capital thrives. Money requires and demands
      competitive growth, focused on obtaining the scarce resource of money
      itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Demurrage</h3>

    <p>
      Demurrage, as outlined by Gesell and Steiner, is the principle of the
      depreciation of money over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This principle is embodied in credex in a more specific way than is
      possible with money. Every credex must expire and lose its power as a
      medium of exchange. If the value promised is not delivered, this default
      risk must be realized and cleared off the balance sheets of affected
      nodes. Were this not the case, these risks would be systemized with
      similar dynamics and results as occur in the money economy.
    </p>

    <p>
      A credex, once issued, will either be fulfilled and fully redeemed by a
      specific date, or any remaining balance will default on that date. In the
      credex ecosystem, this default is known as demurrage. The specificity of
      credex allows us to take demurrage to mean the consumption of the units of
      the medium of exchange within a purely financial context, disassociated
      from the specific consumption of value within the real economy. When a
      credex is redeemed, the real value it represents has been promised,
      provided and consumed, and the credex loses its active power as a medium
      of exchange. When a credex is demurrages, a portion of the value it
      promises is never provided or consumed, and it loses its active power as a
      medium of exchange. In this context, actualized demurrage is a negative
      for both participants involved and for the system as a whole, but the
      possibility of demurrage is a necessary and systemically positive force.
      It is in the interests of every node and the system as a whole to prevent
      demurrage, but demurrage localizes credit risk, and so it must exist as a
      possibility. Elimination of risk would disconnect finance from the
      underlying economic reality, which would be against the interests of all
      nodes.
    </p>

    <h3>Gift and consumption</h3>

    <p>
      Capital accumulates around assets and processes that create and distribute
      economic value. These processes are usually embodied in successful, profit
      producing businesses connected with each other up, down, and across
      multiple value creating flows. Successful investment of the capital that
      accumulates around these clusters of nodes moves the value created there
      elsewhere in the economic network. The purpose of this movement is to
      generate value and capital where it is invested, and also in the form of
      returns to the investing node. Value creation enables capital growth,
      which enables value creation and more capital growth in a positive
      feedback dynamic.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem recognizes and empowers the gift alongside the
      purchase. A gift credex might behave exactly like a purchase credex, but
      is nevertheless identified as a gift because the gift plays a critical and
      recognized role within the credex ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>A full purchase process in the ecosystem includes these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Value is provided by one node to another</li>
      <li>
        A credex is issued and accepted (as a promise to provide reciprocal
        value)
      </li>
      <li>
        The promised value is provided via credloops and the credex is redeemed
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>A full gift process in the ecosystem includes these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Value is generated in production and purchase and accumulates with a
        node
      </li>
      <li>
        A credex is issued and accepted (as a promise to gift accumulated value)
      </li>
      <li>
        The promised value is provided via credloops and the credex is redeemed
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      As critical as value creating purchases are for wealth and wellbeing, the
      gift is still the primal solution to this problem. A well directed gift
      can be even more potent for value creation than a purchase. Charity that
      changes the circumstances of a creative human and allows them to reach
      their full potential can easily provide the greatest return for the wealth
      and wellbeing of all. This potential systemic return is matched only
      perhaps by gifts that increase the natural capital of our earth in a way
      that will impact generations to come. In both cases, the fact that these
      are gifts without expected return is critical, and it is recognized and
      celebrated within the ecosystem.

    <p>
      Just as capital naturally accumulates around value creating processes,
      gifts naturally accumulate around capital. Recognizing and celebrating
      this tendency within the ecosystem will open up entirely new channels for
      the systemic generation of wealth and wellbeing via altruistic gifts,
      charity, and "investing" in the whole rather than the parts, with no
      expectation of personal return.

      In the credex ecosystem, a gift is seen as a purely consumptive activity
      from an economic perspective. In that capacity, the gift has the power to
      counteract the self-referential buildup of capital in a way that releases
      and dampens its potentially dangerous power if left unchecked. At the same
      time as being systemically beneficial, it is deeply humanly fulfilling to
      be able to give and be recognized and appreciated for it. The invisible
      hand of generosity is equally as potent as the invisible hand of the
      market, and equally important for a complete and integrated view of
      economic activity. Credex holds this integrated view, and is able to
      customize individual smart contracts for each step in the process. Money
      simply cannot compete.

      Rudolph Steiner must again be noted here for his contributions
      theoretically distinguishing between the functions and behaviours of
      transaction money, loan/investment money, and gift money. Credex is able
      to implement these principles (and others that already exist or are yet to
      be created) with a specificity and level of sophistication that has never
      before been possible.

    <p>
      The distributed nature of credex will allow ideas and implementations to
      be developed, tested in simulation, prototyped in isolated pockets, and
      scaled. Credex vastly expands the horizons of possibility for financial
      innovation on a technical level and on the level of first principles, is
      unmatched in its ability to test, simulate and provide granular level
      reporting on performance, while also protecting privacy in transparent,
      user controlled ways that can be negotiable to various degrees within each
      credex depending on the protocols for the type of contract being designed
      and the behaviours enabled by the ecosystem.
