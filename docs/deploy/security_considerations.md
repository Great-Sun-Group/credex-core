# Security Considerations

This document outlines important security considerations for the credex-core application deployment and infrastructure management.

## Secrets Management

1. Use GitHub Secrets for all sensitive data:
   - Go to the GitHub repository
   - Navigate to "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
   - Add secrets for sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and access tokens

2. Regularly rotate passwords, API keys, and AWS access keys:
   - Implement a rotation schedule (e.g., every 90 days)
   - Update rotated secrets in GitHub Secrets and other relevant places
   - Ensure the application can handle secret rotation without downtime

3. Use AWS Secrets Manager for storing and retrieving database credentials and other sensitive configuration:
   - Create secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Use the AWS SDK in the application to retrieve secrets at runtime

## Network Security

1. Ensure production databases are not accessible from development or staging environments:
   - Use separate VPCs for each environment
   - Implement proper network ACLs and security groups

2. Implement proper access controls and network security in your AWS environment:
   - Use VPCs with private subnets for application components
   - Use NAT Gateways for outbound internet access from private subnets
   - Implement VPC flow logs for network traffic analysis

3. Restrict access to Neo4j instances by updating security group rules in Terraform:
   - Allow access only from the application's security group
   - Limit SSH access to a bastion host or VPN

4. Ensure LedgerSpace and SearchSpace instances are properly isolated and secured:
   - Use separate security groups for LedgerSpace and SearchSpace
   - Implement network segmentation to control traffic between instances

## Access Management

1. Implement least privilege access for IAM roles used by ECS tasks to access AWS resources:
   - Create specific IAM roles for each service with only necessary permissions
   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies

2. Regularly review and update IAM policies, especially those related to AMI management:
   - Set up a recurring task to review IAM policies
   - Remove unused permissions and add new ones as needed

3. Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce security baselines across accounts:
   - Implement SCPs to restrict actions across all accounts (e.g., prohibit deletion of CloudTrail logs)

## Application Security

1. Implement proper input validation and sanitization in the application:
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

2. Use HTTPS for all external communications:
   - Configure ALB listeners to use HTTPS
   - Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirection

3. Implement proper error handling to avoid information disclosure:
   - Use generic error messages for users
   - Log detailed error information for debugging

## Monitoring and Auditing

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing API calls:
   - Enable CloudTrail in all regions
   - Configure CloudTrail to log to a centralized S3 bucket

2. Set up alerts for suspicious activities:
   - Create CloudWatch alarms for unusual API calls or login attempts
   - Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for advanced threat detection

3. Regularly review and analyze logs:
   - Set up a process for regular log review
   - Use log analysis tools to identify patterns and anomalies

## Compliance and Governance

1. Implement a change management process:
   - Require peer reviews for all changes
   - Use pull requests and branch protection rules in GitHub

2. Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing:
   - Schedule periodic security assessments
   - Address findings promptly and track remediation efforts

3. Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all systems and data:
   - Use AWS Config to maintain an inventory of AWS resources
   - Implement tagging strategies for better resource management

## Continuous Security Improvement

1. Stay informed about security best practices and emerging threats:
   - Subscribe to security advisories and newsletters
   - Attend security conferences and workshops

2. Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches:
   - Set up automated dependency updates (e.g., using Dependabot)
   - Implement a patch management process

3. Conduct security training for team members:
   - Provide regular security awareness training
   - Offer role-specific security training for developers and operations staff

By adhering to these security considerations, you can significantly enhance the security posture of the credex-core application and its supporting infrastructure. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and it's crucial to regularly review and update your security measures.
