### DCO on Separate Instance Analysis

Running the DCO on a separate instance could potentially allow for reducing the size of the LedgerSpace instance. Here's an analysis of this approach:

1. **Separate DCO Instance**:
   - Instance Type: r5.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 128 GB RAM)
   - Usage: Approximately 10 minutes per day
   - Monthly Cost: $15 (based on on-demand pricing for 5 hours of usage per month)

2. **Reduced LedgerSpace Instance**:
   - Current: r5.12xlarge ($4,200/month)
   - Potential Reduction: r5.8xlarge ($2,800/month)
   - Monthly Savings: $1,400

3. **Net Impact**:
   - Additional Cost (DCO Instance): $15
   - Potential Savings (LedgerSpace Reduction): $1,400
   - Net Monthly Savings: $1,385

**Considerations**:
