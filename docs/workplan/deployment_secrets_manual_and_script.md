# Streamlined Workplan: Deployment Secrets Management

## Objective
Implement a simple and secure approach for managing deployment secrets using GitHub Environments, ensuring it works for both manual deployments from a dev environment and automated deployments in production/staging environments.

## Approach
1. Store all secrets in GitHub Environments for staging and production.
2. Modify deployment code to retrieve secrets from GitHub Environments wherever it is called from.

## Steps

1. Set up GitHub Environments (5-10 minutes)
   - Create 'staging' and 'production' environments in GitHub repository settings.
   - Add necessary secrets to each environment (AWS credentials, API keys, etc.).

2. Update `deploy_and_verify.sh` script (10-15 minutes)
   - Modify script to use environment variables for all secrets.
   - Ensure script can run in both dev and production/staging environments.

3. Update GitHub Actions workflow (if applicable) (5-10 minutes)
   - Modify workflow to use secrets from the appropriate GitHub Environment.

4. Test deployment process (10-15 minutes)
   - Test manual deployment from dev environment.

5. Update documentation (5-10 minutes)
   - Add brief instructions on managing secrets in GitHub Environments.
   - Update deployment instructions if necessary.

Total estimated time: 35-60 minutes

## Implementation

1. Add all necessary secrets to production and staging Github environments (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, etc.).
2. Update `deploy_and_verify.sh`:
   - Remove any hardcoded secrets or local environment variable usage.
   - Use environment variables for all secrets, which will be provided by GitHub Environments.
3. If using GitHub Actions, update the workflow file to use the appropriate environment:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     deploy:
       environment: staging  # or production
       # rest of the job configuration
   ```
4. Test the deployment process manually and through automation (if applicable).
5. Update README or deployment documentation with new secret management instructions.

This approach ensures that secrets are securely stored in GitHub Environments and can be accessed whether the deployment is run manually from a dev environment or automatically in a production/staging environment.
