      The market DCO incorporates full-cost accounting into prices that
      participating businesses charge and par- ticipating members pay. The
      purpose of the market DCO is to incorporate the full ecological costs of
      produc- tion into market prices at every stage of the economic process.
      This, but only this, is required for the organic economy to maintain
      harmony with the biosphere. Your participation in the DCO starts to bring
      your consump- tion into the organic economy, where it can exist in
      symbiotic resonance with our natural world.

      Renewable resources are harvested by the organic economy at a level that
      can be sustained indefinitely. Non-renewable resources are harvested at a
      level and utilized in a manner that respects future generations. All
      wastes released are feedstock for biological or naturally- occurring
      chemical processes, at a level that does not have a negative systemic
      impact on our overall habitat over any time scale, and that minimizes
      local environ- mental degradations. Working in a symbiotic relation- ship,
      the organic economy is formed by its environment, and forms its
      environment, in mutually beneficial ways. Wastes exiting the organic

      The relationship that the organic economy has with its natural environment
      sets the constraints within which it operates. Bringing our consumption
      within these constraints, and therefore within the organic econ- omy,
      opens the door to endless prosperity. Consuming outside the organic
      economy—outside the constraints of sustainability—leads inevitably towards
      collective im- poverishment.

      One credcoin is equal to one equal share of the nat- ural wealth entering
      the organic economy today. This is a real, specific, market-generated
      value. It is not a the- oretical value, an idea, or a placeholder. Because
      it is a real value, associated with real transactions, everything can be

      circulates through the organic economy, and with this information, goods
      and services can be certified in any way desired. Using the crypto-

      harvest of natu- ral resources across all domains. Millions and billions

      This creates a dynamic in which currency can be de- posited, transaction
      payments can be made, and wealth can circulate completely free of charge
      within the eco- system, but a 2% (later market-driven) fee is borne when
      accumulated wealth exits into the money economy by being exchanged for
      currency. This enables businesses or individuals who make profit in credex
      to choose to withdraw it into the money economy, but incentivizes the
      value to remain in credex. Critically, this 2% also creates a profit
      centre that can initially be used to sus- tain the credex ecosystem
      infrastructure until it can be grounded in a member-governed and
      member-funded manner, leaving profit and financial innovation to be
      pursued within the private sector. The DCO strategy fully utilizes the

      The driving dynamic in an economically empty world can be expressed as:
      more capital equals more extrac- tion of natural wealth equals more real
      wealth equals more capital. The ever-evolving fiat money systems of today
      were birthed and raised in an economically empty world, and in this world
      they outcompeted all alterna- tives because they deploy capital by fiat,
      without need- ing it to first accumulate. Fiat systems can deploy capital
      as debt instead of surplus, with the expectation that the deployed capital
      will be used to create real value to pay back the debt. In an economically
      empty world, this expectation is relatively easily fulfilled by the
      creation of real economic value by the deployed capital. But this return
      on fiat-deployed capital is often based ultimately on an unsustainable
      level of natural resource harvest. Instead of focusing on adding economic
      value to a fixed resource base, this kind of capital is focused on
      extract- ing as much economic value as possible from the natu- ral world,
      as quickly as possible.

      once fueled real growth and enabled fiat to out- compete all alternatives,

      This is why, despite a few apparent booms, the fiat money economies have

      investment demanded by the fiat economies has no- where to go, so forcibly
      invested capital is continually building up in the system as speculative
      excess. But forc- ing financial capital to act outside its nature

      Credcoin is the primary unit of account within the cre- dex ecosystem.
      Every value expressed in the ecosystem is stored in CXX, and so is always
      expressed in relation to this primary economic reference point, and in
      direct relationship to every other value. Every value also has a
      denomination, and a face value in that denomination. The face value of a
      credex takes precedence over the CXX value, because the denomination of
      the transaction is the reference point agreed to by both counterparties.
      The transacted value will fluctuate in relationship to all other assets
      and denominations, including CXX. The value of a credex will always remain
      fixed in reference to this face denomination that was chosen when it was
      created.

      Every credex has a face value in a specific denom- ination and a value in

      value. Although the CXX value is always the numeric reference point for

      economic value expressed within the ecosystem) is updated every 24 hours
      in the DCO so that as the mathematical average expressed by CXX fluctuates
      daily, the face value of the credex remains locked to the denomination
      agreed by the counterpar- ties. With these daily updates, all numbers
      remain true in relationship to each other, and also true in relation- ship

      By rebalancing the equation and adjusting values every day in this way we
      maintain our conceptual ref- erence point. For the day, we stabilize on
      the specific value of the relationship between two independent and
      fluctuating variables. When the value of that specific relationship
      changes tomorrow, instead of changing the solution to match the equation,
      the DCO changes the equation to match the solution of 1.000 CXX, and all
      accounts are adjusted accordingly, based on the new economic reality of
      the new day.

      By implementing small daily adjustments to reflect market-driven economic
      reality, credcoin avoids large- scale market corrections where reality
      reasserts itself and value measurements have to be painfully re-evaluated
      across the board. Even when such changes occur (and in free markets they
      will because situations change and humans make mistakes) the equation
      provides the safety valve of stabilized values as of the day contracted,
      simply by denominating in credcoin. In this case, it is only our internal
      sense of the value of 1.000 CXX that needs to adjust. Our credex ecosystem
      accounts and credcoin transactions will already reflect the change.

      participants are also forced out of using the numerical reference point of
      money. It is economically counter- productive to think in terms of
      currency-based numbers if the currency is hyperinflating around you. What
      mat- ters is real relative values. How many loaves of bread is my time
      worth? How many litres of gas? Or maybe how much value relative to what I
      pay for accommodations? Those are the questions that always matter. Money

      In the credex ecosystem, denominations can be fixed to any market price or
      formula, and once fixed, they are stabilized in the specific ways intended
      by the counter- parties. This property can be used to create a denomina-
      tion to meet every need. For example, in a specific city experiencing
      hyperinflation, bread purchased at neigh- borhood bakeries may be a
      staple. It is relatively trivial to collect the price being charged by a
      random represen- tative sample of bakeries every day, create a denomina-
      tion from this data, and enable members to transact in that denomination.

      The credex ecosystem doesn’t exactly solve the prob- lems of currency, it
      just makes them immaterial within its sphere. It sidesteps them. In
      regions where the cur- rency is relatively stable, but inflating at a
      moderate rate (as expected in a healthy modern fiat money economy),
      sidestepping inflation might be most easily done by us- ing a currency
      value adjusted by an inflation index, for example USD times a daily CPI
      adjustment. If inflation is your primary concern in an environment like
      this, a denomination that implements that principle might be your best
      option. And if your currency environment is relatively stable, it may make
      the most economic sense to simply use credexes denominated in your local
      currency. It’s completely up to you and each of your counterparties.

      than monetary imbal- ances. A credex is a financial solution, and

      The limited liability corporation is an innovation of the corporate model
      that protects investors from losing anything more than their investment.
      If a limited cor- poration creates liabilities greater than its assets,
      then becomes insolvent, it goes under owing value to credi- tors. However,
      the owners of this limited liability corpo- ration are not personally
      accountable for those debts or damages. Owners and investors can lose
      everything they have invested in the limited corporation, but beyond that
      level they are isolated from responsibility for (legit- imate and legal)
      corporate actions and decisions, even though as owners they bear ultimate
      responsibility for those decisions, and receive all of the profit these
      de- cisions may have created.

      The limited corporation limits downside risk for in- vestors. Viewed
      through the lens of human sovereignty, groups of individual humans are
      ultimately responsible for the actions of every human organization, and
      allow- ing corporations to create a shield between actions and
      consequences runs counter to core ecosystem principles. Limiting the
      liability of humans for their own decisions just means that the

      advantage in an economically empty world. Limited liability corporations
      artificially decrease risk for investors. This artificially increases the
      availability of investment capital. In an economically empty world, this
      increased capital can usually be put to positive eco- nomic use to
      generate real return. However, in a full world, this artificial altering
      of natural consequences to generate growth becomes a systemically negative
      force. When these artificially increased levels of capital are run through
      the debt-based multipliers of the fiat money system, it forms a potent
      engine for growth and expansion. This engine powered successful economies
      for generations, but it becomes uncompetitive in an eco- nomically full

      The principle of a limited corporation is also funda- mentally at odds

      A factory may treat toxic sludge as an externality and dump it in the
