      <h2>An alternative to currency</h2>
      <p>
        A credex is an alternative to money itself, founded directly on
        peer-to-peer trust between sovereign humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem offers simple tools that continuously build and
        verify trust, and straightforward ways to repeatedly use that trust to
        create and exchange real value. Credex builds economic resilience and
        everyday prosperity, enabling transactions free of the distortions and
        requirements imposed by money.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a money economy, we can only do business to the degree that we have
        access to money. And in a money economy, the money supply must be
        restricted or the value of the currency will plummet. Locked within a
        money economy, we experience inflation and deflation as necessary evils,
        and we depend on sovereign powers outside of ourselves to constantly
        hold these evils at bay.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the credex ecosystem, we can do business to the degree that we trust
        each other, and there are no outside restrictions imposed on trust. In
        the credex ecosystem, inflation becomes a trivial problem that we
        sovereign humans can sidestep with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        A credex is simply an IOU that has been supercharged with modern
        technology and a straightforward principle. This principle is both
        massively scalable and deeply layered, and its implementation is a
        direct and potent empowerment of citizens, businesses, and communities
        everywhere.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Credex Principle</h2>
      <p>
        This simple, logical, and radical idea has the power to change the
        world. On this humble foundation we can build a prosperous, free, and
        sustainable future together:
      </p>
      <h3 class="big-words">
        If I owe you,<br />
        and you owe them,<br />
        and they owe me...<br />
        we're square.
      </h3>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verified peer-to-peer trust</h2>
      <p>
        When you accept a credex in payment, you are trusting that your
        counterparty can and will provide you with goods or services of your
        choice, exactly equivalent to the agreed value, within the agreed time.
        This could be money, or it could be things you would otherwise purchase
        with money.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem enables your counterparty to use their own
        capacities and assets to deliver you the specific goods or services that
        you desire, through transaction chains that might circle your
        neighbourhood or span the globe. A credex goes where it needs to go to
        deliver the promised value. A credex is an IOU with tech-enabled
        superpowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A credex creates trust and is powered by trust. As you make good on your
        promises, you establish a trustworthy track record that assures future
        counterparties of your commitment and capacity to provide value. In the
        credex ecosystem your trustworthiness can easily be proven, while your
        personal information stays private and secure, in your sovereign data
        vault.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Human sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        Within the credex ecosystem, you are a sovereign entity with
        trust-enabled, credex-enacted economic superpowers at your disposal. You
        can deliver value across time and space to fulfill the promises you make
        to those you do business with. You can move your consumption towards
        bountiful alignment with the natural world. You can live the life of a
        free, creative and wealthy human being, and empower others to do the
        same.
      </p>

      <h3>You belong</h3>
      <p>
        As a sovereign human, you sit in your rightful place on this earth.
        Biologically this is your home and your habitat. Spiritually you are
        connected to the cosmos. Physically you are part of the web of processes
        that give you life. Your presence on earth is a blessing. You belong
        here. This is your world and it sustains you.
      </p>

      <h3>You are responsible</h3>
      <p>
        As a sovereign human, you are responsible for your decisions and
        actions. You are responsible for the ways you shape the world. You are
        karmically, legally, and spiritually responsible. What you do matters.
        You have the power to decide who you are in every moment, and who you
        are makes a difference in your world.
      </p>

      <h3>Natural consequences</h3>
      <p>
        What we each do matters. All of us impact our world and create new
        realities as we go. And what we all do together really matters. Together
        we forge new universes.
      </p>
      <p>So let's get to work.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sovereignty starts here</h2>
      <p>
        Sovereignty is not something that is granted by any outside power.
        Sovereignty is a deeply human truth that we can activate in ourselves
        and engage in others. In the credex ecosystem, our starting point for
        sovereignty is the power to create a medium of exchange. A sovereign
        economic power can issue and manage a currency, and the credex ecosystem
        is an environment where you are able to use your own sovereign
        currency-creating power to efficiently manage your own personal,
        household, business, and investment economies in respectful, empowering,
        and mutually beneficial cooperation with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your currency is your word. Your currency is your smart-contracted
        promise to provide value. Your currency is your IOU. As you build your
        wealth without money, your word will become stronger than currency.
        Credexes make it possible, but it's your own responsibility to make that
        possibility real.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you express your currency-creating power through credex IOUs, and
        accept the credex IOUs of other members, the credex ecosystem finds the
        credloops. If I owe you, and you owe Alice, and Alice owes Bob, and Bob
        owes Charlie, and Charlie owes Eve, and Eve owes meâ€¦ the ecosystem will
        find this credloop and redeem each of these credexes up to the smallest
        value within the looped credexes, leaving outstanding balances on the
        rest.
      </p>

      <img
        src="../images/credex_principle_flowchart.png"
        alt="Credex Principle Flowchart"
        class="credex-principle-flowchart"
      />

      <p>
        These credloops can be of any length, and each credex in these loops can
        be denominated in any currency or any asset or derivative formula. A
        credex can be part of multiple loops until it is redeemed. A credex can
        be denominated in Canadian dollars, US dollars, euros with a daily
        inflation adjustment, loaves of bread, ounces of gold, barrels of oil,
        specific US Treasuries, shares of Huawei, or points on the S&P 500. A
        credex can be denominated in the difference in the 4-week rolling
        average hedge ratio of a specified group of call options vs changes in
        the price of an index of Colombian coffees at the farm gate multiplied
        by 103.4%... if that's what the counterparties want. A credex can also
        be denominated in credcoin, but we'll get to that later. A credex of any
        denomination channels our natural sovereignty into real-world economic
        and financial superpowers that can be applied in any situation. Credex
        gives us the freedom to make our own choices and face our own
        consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sovereignty expressed through credex is one of belonging and
        responsibility. You are welcomed as a currency-creating entity. You
        belong in your rightful place in the credex ecosystem, just like you
        belong in your rightful place on the earth and within the biosphere. And
        you are responsible for your decisions and your actions. You are
        responsible to fulfill your promises, and you will face the natural
        consequences of your choices.
      </p>

      <h2>The credex smart contract</h2>
      <p>
        A credex is a contract for one party to provide a specific amount of
        value to another within a specific time:
      </p>

      <h4>Template</h4>
      <p>
        *member1* promises to provide *member2* with *amount* *denomination*
        worth of value by *date*.
      </p>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>
        Alice promises to provide Bob with $10.00 CAD worth of value by
        <!-- doesn't work in local dev env -->
        <script>
          document.getElementById("date").textContent = moment()
            .add(3, "weeks")
            .format("MMMM Do YYYY");
        </script>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        Every accepted credex bears the digital signature of each party to the
        transaction. These counterparty signatures activate it to connect in
        credloops. Your outstanding credex is always searching, on behalf of
        both you and your counterparty, for the ways it can redeem itself. When
        a credloop is found, every credex along its path is redeemed by the
        amount of the lowest-value credex in the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        In accounting language, an outstanding credex is a payment secured
        directly between counterparties by a matching, auditable, contingent
        liability and contingent asset pair, stored on a shared ledger. Credexes
        are a straightforward application of the centuries-old principles of
        double-entry accounting. However, instead of merely tracking asset
        account balances, as is required with money accounts, credex accounts
        also differentiate between each specific payable and receivable entry.
        Each entry is a contingent liability for one party (payable), and a
        contingent asset for the other (receivable). Then the ecosystem clears
        these imbalances against each other wherever possible, using standard,
        automated accounting practices, applied at scale across the network as
        credloops, leaving an auditable, privacy-preserving trail for each
        account. From this foundational feature springs an incredibly rich
        environment for value creating exchange and capital growth utilizing
        ledger-based, low-friction, peer-to-peer smart contract solutions
        instead of money. Credexes replace money itself with something
        fundamentally different.
      </p>
      <p>
        A credex is like a quantum tunnel linking your balance sheet securely
        with your counterparty's balance sheet, and effortlessly transporting
        the values you create and the values you require. Every credex opens a
        customized, peer-to-peer, stable, auditable, and GAAP-compliant portal
        between counterparties across economic time and space. (GAAP = Generally
        Accepted Accounting Principles)
      </p>
      <p>
        Credexes are independent of money, because even if a credex is
        denominated in CAD, no Canadian dollars are ever required or even
        desired to fulfill the contract. The promise is to provide value in a
        specific measure. The contract is specifically for the value, not the
        money (or other denomination) which measures it.
      </p>
      <p>
        One reason that credexes can be fundamentally peer-to-peer, vis-a-vis
        the centralization of money, is that they do not require everyone in the
        network to agree to a single unified reference point for value. Values
        are calculated and compared daily on the fly across all the
        denominations, assets, and formulas, on the conditions that have been
        smart-contracted by every pair of counterparties.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Demurrage</h2>
      <p>
        It is in everyone's best interests that all contracts are fulfilled. If
        I accept a credex and my counterparty does not make good on their
        promise, then I've lost the value that was promised and my counterparty
        has degraded their own trustworthiness. These are economically damaging
        impacts to each of us, and they are transmitted across the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the credex ecosystem, demurrage occurs when a member defaults on a
        contract to provide value. The potential for demurrage must exist in
        order to keep our financial tokens (promises) aligned with the
        underlying real economy, and the real values being created and
        exchanged. Yet the actualization of demurrage is against the interests
        of the entire ecosystem, and particularly against the interests of the
        counterparties involved, who will naturally use all the tools at their
        disposal to avert this outcome. They have the support of the entire
        ecosystem in doing so.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Zero recourse and natural consequences</h2>
      <p>
        Credex smart contracts are unenforceable (without recourse). They are
        based purely on trust, and the only direct consequences that I will bear
        for failing to provide the value that I have promised is coded directly
        into the credex that I have signed: this demurrage will become part of
        my permanent transaction history in the ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only direct consequence is that my demurrage is tracked. However,
        the cascading natural responses to this (non-)action and consequence
        could be significant, especially past certain thresholds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future counterparties will request my account history in some form
        before trusting me, and will likely have demurrage thresholds past which
        they will simply not transact with me. And even below that threshold
        they may increase their prices to me, having to play the odds that some
        percentage of their trust in me will be misplaced.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Second chances and charity</h2>
      <p>
        No discussion of decisions and consequences can be complete without
        touching on charity. Shit happens. People make mistakes. Natural
        disasters happen. Disastrous business decisions happen. People take
        risks and come up empty. The world changes and life changes, and humans
        are always vulnerable. Nothing works out exactly as planned on this
        adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your wealth-creating sovereign superpowers shine that much brighter when
        they are kindled with authentic care towards those in need. Charity
        arises naturally from that place. A human facing the natural
        consequences of not following through on their promises is a human who
        is in trouble and deserves support, and then a second chance, and a
        third chance, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust and verify, trust and verify. Give space for those struggling to
        find themselves, so they can re-arise as trustworthy peers who now have
        a story of overcoming hardship fading into their past.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Bad actors</h2>
      <p>
        Humans are capable of truly horrible things. Some humans sometimes act
        on those capabilities. And some are simply out to take advantage of
        other people and get a free ride to whatever degree they can get away
        with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem links actions to accounts, and accounts to humans.
        Your account history may be your own, but every time you want to enter
        into an economic relationship, your counterparty has the right to
        request verifiable data on your trustworthiness. This data can be run
        through trusted third-party algorithms to maintain whatever degrees of
        privacy the counterparties require between them. Those who have a
        pattern of broken promises may be worthy of charity and of respect as
        humans, but they don't make great counterparties for value-building
        transactions until they have re-established their trustworthiness from
        the ground up. And it's up to each counterparty to determine what that
        means in each situation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Regulations</h2>
      <p>
        Every human is subject to the laws and regulations of their respective
        government and jurisdiction. Credex provides each of us with a private,
        auditable ledger for which we are fully accountable. Any authorities who
        have the right to demand an accounting of our money transactions also
        have the right to demand an accounting of our credex transactions. The
        credex ecosystem is not a place for bad actors to take refuge from
        consequences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Trust again</h2>
      <p>
        Peer-to-peer trust between sovereign humans changes everything. The
        credex ecosystem empowers trust at scale through simple, decentralized,
        and potent methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only standards that you are held accountable to are your own. No one
        forces you to enter into contracts. You don't have to issue credexes.
        When you decide to issue credexes, no one forces you to follow through
        on your promises. All that the credex ecosystem provides is a shared
        ledger where any defaults on these promises are noted. This simple
        mechanism provides a secure transparency that enables the exponential
        growth of trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trust is continually leveraged via the shared ledger into a secure
        medium of exchange, through which we create value for ourselves and
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where trust-enabled value is created, trust-based capital grows. Where
        trust-based capital grows, investments, innovation, generosity, and
        creativity thrive, and widespread multigenerational wealth can be built.
