we need a system prompt (and potentially some example starting prompts as well) for in depth research on economics across africa. we'll be looking at large scale patterns and value flows across the continent, continental imports and exports, and country, region, and city specific data. Financial innovations, fintech, crypto, mobile money, traditional banking, and cash are of interest.

Credit is a critical focus. Flows of credit into the continent, their source by location and type (private, gov, other), flows across the continent, and lending in specific markets. Financial industry in general, stocks, bonds, exchanges and markets, capital flows and sources of funding for small, mid, and large corporates, with a particular focus on micro scale entreprenuers such as tradespeople, street vendors, solopreneurs, family farmers. Food production and financing is of great interest.

Small scale cooperative solutions such as credit circles and gift circles where each groups self finance one member at a time are of interest.

this is background for the business planning of a fintech startup that is about to launch in Zimbabwe, with immediate asiprations to enter markets across the continent. our core product is an API, with the first client app a whatsapp chatbot.
