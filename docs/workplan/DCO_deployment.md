# DCO Deployment Workplan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the process for automating infrastructure updates and redeployments as part of the Daily Credcoin Offering (DCO) process. The goal is to ensure that our infrastructure remains up-to-date while minimizing disruption to our services and maintaining data integrity.

## 2. Process Flow

1. The existing DailyCredcoinOffering cronjob will be extended to include infrastructure update checks and deployments.
2. After running the DCO, the system will check for any external or internal changes that require app or infrastructure updates.
3. If changes are detected, the system will initiate the appropriate redeployment processes.
4. Special handling will be implemented for database redeployments to ensure data integrity.
5. After successful updates (if any), the DCO process will proceed by ending as usual.

## 3. Detecting Changes

### 3.1 External Changes

To detect external changes, implement a function that checks for:

- New AMI versions for Neo4j or other services
- Updates to dependent services or libraries
- Changes in AWS service offerings that affect our infrastructure

### 3.2 Internal Changes

To detect internal changes, implement a function that checks for:

- Updates to terraform or github workflow files
- Changes in application code that require redeployment

## 4. Redeployment Process

### 4.1 General Infrastructure Updates

For non-database infrastructure updates:

1. Apply Terraform changes using `terraform apply`
2. Update ECS task definitions and services
3. Perform rolling updates of ECS services to minimize downtime

### 4.2 Database Redeployment

For Neo4j database redeployments:

1. Create new Neo4j instances with updated configurations
2. Perform a backup of the existing databases
3. Restore data to the new instances
4. Validate data integrity in the new instances
5. Update connection strings in the application configuration
6. Switch traffic to the new instances
7. Terminate old instances after a successful transition

### 4.3 Application Deployments

1. Ensure that the deployment process also deploys the latest code
2. For application updates that do not require infrastructure refresh, deploy to existing infrastructure

## 5. Integration with DailyCredcoinOffering

Modify the DailyCredcoinOffering cronjob to include the infrastructure update checks. Ensure careful error handling and rollback to previous resources if infrastructure updates fail.

## 6. Security Enhancements

1. Implement least privilege access for all IAM roles used in the deployment process
2. Regularly review and update IAM policies, especially those related to deployment
3. Implement a secrets rotation policy for all environments
4. Ensure proper network security and access controls for all AWS environments

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring:

1. Log all detected changes and update processes
2. Set up alerts for failed updates or prolonged update processes
3. Monitor system performance during and after updates
4. Implement a dashboard for visualizing the status of infrastructure components
5. Enhance logging mechanisms to provide more detailed insights into deployment behavior

## 8. Rollback Procedures

Develop and document rollback procedures for each type of update:

1. For non-database updates, maintain the ability to revert to the previous Terraform state
2. For database updates, keep the old instances running until the new ones are fully validated
3. Implement automated rollback triggers based on predefined criteria (e.g., failed health checks)

## 9. Testing and Validation

1. Develop a comprehensive test suite for the update detection and deployment processes
2. Create a staging environment that mirrors production for testing updates
3. Implement canary deployments for gradual rollout of changes
4. Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure rollback procedures are effective

## 10. Documentation and Training

1. Maintain up-to-date documentation of the entire process
2. Provide training for the operations team on handling manual interventions if needed
3. Establish a change management process for reviewing and approving infrastructure updates
4. Maintain a changelog to track significant changes to the deployment process and infrastructure
5. Create and maintain architecture diagrams to visualize the system and deployment process

## 11. Performance and Scalability

1. Implement load testing as part of the deployment process to ensure the application can handle expected traffic
2. Set up auto-scaling policies for ECS services to handle varying loads
3. Regularly review and optimize Terraform configurations for better resource management and cost-efficiency
