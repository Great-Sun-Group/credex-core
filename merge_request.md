# Implement Intuitive Test Runner for Credex API

This merge request introduces a new, more flexible and intuitive testing system for the Credex API, with a focus on comprehensive testing of the Member module.

## Summary of Changes

- Created a custom test runner script (`tests/run.js`) to handle various test scenarios
- Updated `package.json` to use the new test runner
- Updated testing guide with comprehensive instructions for new testing commands
- Implemented and fixed tests for all six endpoints in the Member module:
  1. onboardMember
  2. login
  3. getMemberByHandle
  4. getMemberDashboardByPhone
  5. authForTierSpendLimit
  6. setDCOparticipantRate

## Key Features

- Run all tests or tests for specific modules
- Easy environment switching (local, dev, stage)
- Run specific tests by name
- Intuitive command structure (e.g., `npm test dev Member`)

## Improvements

- Fixed issue with phone number format in Member tests
- Ensured all Member module tests pass successfully
- Improved test reliability and consistency
- Addressed tier spend limit constraints in tests

## Test Coverage

All six endpoints in the Member module are now covered by passing tests:

1. Onboarding a new member
2. Logging in a member
3. Getting member by handle
4. Getting member dashboard by phone
5. Authenticating for tier spend limit
6. Setting DCO participant rate

## Next Steps

- Apply similar comprehensive testing to other API modules (e.g., Account, Avatar, Credex)
- Implement additional test scenarios for edge cases and error handling
- Set up CI/CD pipeline to run these tests automatically on code changes
- Review and update the testing guide as new testing patterns or requirements emerge

This merge request significantly improves the testing infrastructure for the Credex API, particularly for the Member module, ensuring more robust and reliable code.
