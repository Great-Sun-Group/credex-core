      <h2>Gifts</h2>
      <p>
        Credcoin exists because humans want it to. Credcoin came into existence
        because a single human wanted it to, and it will exist as long as any
        single human wants it to. As long as the technological infrastructure
        exists, credcoin is an option that is open to us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credcoin principle is an expression of sovereignty in which
        responsibility leads to belonging. Every day that you take a measure of
        personal responsibility for making good on your debt to all for the
        natural resources that you consume by voluntarily participating in the
        gift portion of the DCO, you receive your personal birthright of 1.000
        CXX. Every day that at least one human participates in the DCO, the
        value of credcoin can be determined, and the DCO will continue to anchor
        the credex ecosystem.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The power of gifts</h2>
      <p>
        In a world where the organic economy thrives at scale, your gift to the
        DCO is a relatively small portion of the total value that you
        contribute. In a world where the organic economy is the only economy,
        your DCO gift is pure charity, gifted to all on a sliding scale where
        the greatest positive impact is on those whose resource consumption is
        lowest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our world today, in which the organic economy is only starting to be
        recognized and cultivated, your DCO gift is what powers the heartbeat of
        organic economic circulation. Your gift is what makes the organic
        economy real. Your gift brings your consumption into the measured flows
        of the fully manifest and measurable organic economy. Your gift enables
        sovereignty, freedom, sustainability, mutual wealth creation, and
        economic justice, and supports the existence of the credex ecosystem.
        The amount of your gift can be small, but the leveraged impact will be
        massive.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gift mechanics</h2>
      <p>
        Credcoin exists because humans want to make good on their debt to all
        for their consumption of natural resources. The most direct path to act
        on this desire is to give in the DCO.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your DCO gift is given in currency, of any denomination. These gifts are
        pooled together and held, and promissory notes are issued back to each
        DCO participant for one equal share of the total value pooled. These
        promissory notes are contracts for 1.000 CXX. In a world where the
        organic economy is just emerging into consciousness and the gift DCO is
        the backbone of credcoin, one credcoin is equal to one equal share of
        the currency that has been pooled and held. In this newly forming
        organic economy, pools of currency held in audited accounts back the
        1.000 CXX contracts that are issued to each participant.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gift levels</h2>
      <p>
        Each participant sets their own level of gift in credcoin. Until the
        market DCO is implemented, a gift amount over 1.000 CXX indicates
        acknowledgement of consumption of more than one equal share of natural
        resources. This level of gift is appropriate for the global wealthy,
        including most of us in North America, Europe, Japan, modernized parts
        of China, many global cities, and other regions and localities where
        wealth and capital has accumulated.
      </p>
      <p>I participate in the gift DCO at greater than 1.000 CXX out of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Loyalty, obligation and duty.</strong> I am loyal towards my
          fellow sovereign humans. The resources that sustain me come from
          around the world, and the right to harvest them ultimately belongs to
          all of us as sovereigns. I give to express my loyalty to this
          sovereignty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Charity and wanting to truly help those less economically
            fortunate.</strong
          >
          I give because I want to raise the economic floor for basic human
          existence across the Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Respect for freedom and choice.</strong> The DCO and the
          empowerments and responsibilities it embodies are fundamentally
          non-coercive. I give because I want to embed the values of human
          sovereignty into the core of our global social contract.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The sustainability imperative.</strong> I give because I want
          to ground our economy and our wealth in the bounty of the biosphere,
          instead of its destruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Desire for systemic change built on human-centric and earth-centric
            foundations.</strong
          >
          I give because I want to throw my weight behind this momentum towards
          positive systemic transformation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Belief that the market DCO will be implemented.</strong>
          Price-based signals must be embedded into the organic economy in order
          to align individual human freedom with the global imperative for
          sustainability. I give to lay down a pathway that market-based
          solutions can follow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Desire to bring my personal resource consumption into the organic
            economy,</strong
          >
          starting in a small, simple, and low-risk way.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Full-cost accounting</h2>
      <p>
        The market DCO incorporates full-cost accounting into prices that
        participating businesses charge and participating members pay. The
        purpose of the market DCO is to incorporate the full ecological costs of
        production into market prices at every stage of the economic process.
        This, but only this, is required for the organic economy to maintain
        harmony with the biosphere. Your participation in the DCO starts to
        bring your consumption into the organic economy, where it can exist in
        symbiotic resonance with our natural world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Renewable resources are harvested by the organic economy at a level that
        can be sustained indefinitely. Non-renewable resources are harvested at
        a level and utilized in a manner that respects future generations. All
        wastes released are feedstock for biological or naturally-occurring
        chemical processes, at a level that does not have a negative systemic
        impact on our overall habitat over any time scale, and that minimizes
        local environmental degradations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Symbiotic relationship</h2>
      <p>
        Working in a symbiotic relationship, the organic economy is formed by
        its environment, and forms its environment, in mutually beneficial ways.
        Wastes exiting the organic economy sustain certain streams of natural
        wealth, and natural wealth that has economic value is harvested at
        environmentally sustainable levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship that the organic economy has with its natural
        environment sets the constraints within which it operates. Bringing our
        consumption within these constraints, and therefore within the organic
        economy, opens the door to endless prosperity. Consuming outside the
        organic economy—outside the constraints of sustainability—leads
        inevitably towards collective impoverishment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Market mechanisms</h2>
      <p>
        The sustainably-harvested natural wealth entering the organic economy
        has specific economic value that can be determined via market
        mechanisms. By incorporating this value into organic economy prices, we
        harmonize with the biosphere. By dividing the value equally among all
        participating sovereign humans, we respect the right to one equal share.
        By paying organic economy prices, we fulfill our responsibility to
        provide value to all for our consumption of resources, and we move our
        consumption towards balance with our habitat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organic economy accounting is full-cost accounting, which integrates the
        true cost of natural resources and wastes into the prices of all
        products and services.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Certification over regulation</h2>
      <p>
        The natural wealth entering the organic economy could in theory be
        regulated, and that might be our first instinct. But instead of being
        regulated, it is certified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulation requires broad agreement, compliance, and enforcement, and is
        fundamentally coercive. The regulation-based approach leads to
        campaigning for all-or-nothing victory, implementation at scale, and
        enforced compliance. The regulation-based approach puts implementation
        off into the future and leaves our entire vision in the hands of forces
        beyond our control, which must be overcome before we can live our
        values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certification is nimble, can be applied at different levels and on
        different criteria as needed, and is fundamentally about creating
        informed choice rather than compliance. Certification is implemented in
        the ecosystem with visual badges and codes that are linked to data that
        proves compliance with the criteria of any kind of certification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Making a market and a democracy</h2>
      <p>
        Our starting place is that the natural wealth entering the organic
        economy belongs equally to all. Decisions must be made to define the
        sustainable harvest of natural resources across all domains. Millions
        and billions of decisions must be made, and remade, at global and local
        scales, across short and vast timelines, to define and redefine
        sustainable harvests.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a non-negotiable requirement for a sustainable economy and
        society. Sustainability can't remain a vague idea, it has to be real and
        specific in every context, and it has to change as reality changes or
        our understanding grows. It takes work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are focused on the non-negotiables here, and we must remain open to
        the fact that reasonable people can and will disagree not only about
        what sustainable harvests are, but also about who gets to decide. Many
        different possibilities are imaginable. However, if we truly want to
        extend sovereignty into the political realm, we must operate from the
        premise that democratic processes that prize equality of voice are the
        appropriate tools for these decisions. One sovereign human equals one
        sovereign vote in these matters.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>From politics to business</h2>
      <p>
        From the political sphere, where democracy holds sway, emerges the right
        to harvest a specific natural resource, in a specific quantity, from a
        specific geography. This right forms the backbone of the market DCO.
        This is where business and personal ownership take over and the
        principles of value, markets, and capital hold sway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business takes over from politics by purchasing the politically-granted
        rights to harvest specific natural resources, from a specific location,
        within a specific timeframe, under specific conditions. Through the DCO
        the revenue from this sale is distributed equally amongst all
        participating humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a hundred fish can sustainably be harvested out of a specific lake in
        a specific month, those rights can be auctioned to fishers. They would
        likely be individuals, whose families would feast.
      </p>
      <p>
        If fifty tonnes of fish can be sustainably harvested from an ocean
        ecosystem in a specific month, those rights can be auctioned to fishers.
        They would likely be corporate entities that could mobilize resources
        and economic capital to create efficiencies at this scale. Within the
        bounds of sovereignty and sustainability established in the DCO, this
        corporate efficiency that brings lower prices should be celebrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Capital that accumulates through serving human needs expressed through
        free-market choices, in harmony with the biosphere and respecting
        sovereignty, is to be celebrated as the highest economic good, matched
        only by the gifting enabled by such riches.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Getting real</h2>
      <p>
        Through the DCO we take personal responsibility for bringing our own
        consumption into the organic economy in a simple and direct way,
        exercising our rights and responsibilities without demanding anything of
        anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't need international treaties, broad agreements, and full
        compliance for us to start to bring our own personal consumption into
        the organic economy. We are habituated to think that we need someone in
        charge to fix things. We need to work together, but we cannot let the
        actions or inactions of others cause us to abdicate our personal
        responsibility to our Earth and our fellow humans.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Badge-based implementation</h2>
      <p>
        Natural resources can enter the organic economy at any point in their
        life cycle. Human consumption in one form or another drives all economic
        activity. We do not need to fight political wars to force multinational
        fishing companies to buy rights to fisheries, rights that they have in
        fact already been granted by existing regulations. That approach, and
        that entire way of thinking, leads to disempowered dead ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        A fish can enter the organic economy from my kitchen, from the local
        retail fish market, the delivery truck, the wharf, the boat, or anywhere
        else along the value creation chain, all the way back to the moment it
        becomes a permissibly harvestable resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a badge-based approach, an organic economy badge can be purchased
        at any point along the chain, and from that moment until consumption,
        the resource exists within the organic economy. A retail market could
        buy already certified organic economy fish, or could buy uncertified
        fish and purchase the badges to certify them; either way the result is
        the same. The costs of purchasing the badge will be passed on to the
        consumer, and the proceeds will be distributed equally in the DCO.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>
        The badge-based approach is not intended to replace regulation-based
        limits and protections on natural resources. It is intended to
        demonstrate that we can use limits themselves to form a
        reality-connected economic and financial bedrock capable of supporting a
        thriving organic economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The badge-based approach enables us to take slow and simple steps
        towards our goal, without demanding anything from anyone else.
        Regulations are ultimately required to ensure sustainability and
        fairness, but the far greater need is for economic models that work in
        cooperation with our environment. We need to experiment and build, not
        fight political wars over regulation. Especially when no one really has
        all the answers yet anyways. We've got a lot to figure out together, and
        if we step down the hubris and righteousness we'll drastically increase
        our personal and collective capacity to get shit done.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sovereignty-empowering, badge-based approach opens a path that we
        can proceed along based on free personal choice. We can give ourselves
        permission to start small and low risk, even to use wildly approximate
        values, to innovate, to play and experiment. Our attitude could be… This
        credcoin idea and implementation is pretty neat, what if it works? What
        if it could scale? What if this is the start of something completely
        different?
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't make the credcoin principle real by forcing it, we make it real
        by prototyping it.
