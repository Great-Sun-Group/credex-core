      <h2>Transform power relations</h2>
      <p>
        By orienting on universal human sovereignty, by exploring what we can do together from a non-coercive foundation, by distributing wealth creation, nurturing the growth of capital, and celebrating gifts, the credex ecosystem eliminates the need for a massive amount of the centralization of power that exists in our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of what we take for granted about modern governance may need to be rethought. What if we don't need to fight so viciously about so many things? What if we can take a completely different path?
      </p>
      <p>
        Complete decentralization of power is not possible or desirable, but the amount of centralized governance we actually need may be far, far less than we've always thought. With credex, we may all be able to work directly and cooperatively together to a far greater degree than we've ever before considered. When we prove to ourselves that we can do all this without coercion, why would we tolerate that kind of oppression to continue? Financial oppression is insidious and invisible, but rather than fight it, let's just opt out. Those systems can't exist without our participation, and if we can live into alternatives that respect humanity and democracy, generate widespread multigenerational prosperity, and protect the biosphere, then I say let's do that instead.
      </p>

      <h2>Human dignity and connection</h2>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem is based on human sovereignty and human relationship. The credcoin principle and the DCO are based on a fundamental respect for the dignity and belonging of every human. In the DCO, these moral ideas are translated into concrete realities and real economic values. In the DCO, we honour the sovereignty of every participant with a tithe of one equal portion of the value of the natural wealth that we consume. In the DCO, our own sovereignty is tithed by every participant with one equal share of the value of the natural wealth that they each have consumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This foundational and respectful ecosystem relationship is recalculated and renewed every 24 hours. The tithes are real, and they are tracked in our credex account ledgers and balances. Values received can be spent in the ecosystem, and values contributed are likewise real.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way, human dignity is honoured in a concrete way, and this daily activity forms the basic value reference point for all other economic activity, as it deposits the 1.000 CXX reference value to every participant's account.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this foundation, the ecosystem extends to enable direct, respectful, economic relationships between counterparties. From this foundation of mutual respect and trust comes mutual value, wealth, capital, and generosity. These human-to-human relationships show us the ways that we are truly interconnected. Asset money obscures these realities, but they've always been here.
      </p>

      <h2>Sustainable prosperity</h2>
      <p>
        Credcoin blazes a trail towards sustainable prosperity by forging a realistic solution from the raw economic, political, and cultural values and truths of our time. Prosperity requires sustainability, and full cost accounting is the simple and powerful way to reunite these values and truths so they work together on behalf of humanity and the biosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on a sustainable flow of natural wealth, the organic economy offers opportunities for literally unlimited economic growth across generations, and a realistic path towards widespread multigenerational prosperity. All of this wealth arises naturally from harmonizing our economic relationship to the biosphere, and freeing human ingenuity and market forces to do what they do best.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Eliminate abject poverty</h2>
      <p>
        Implemented at scale, the DCO provides all of us with a minimal daily flow of value, which we accept as our human birthright. Until markets are established, it is impossible to know what this daily value will be, but whatever it is will raise the floor on basic economic existence everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Natural wealth may be the foundation of our economy, but economic value encompasses much more than natural wealth. Total economic value equals natural wealth plus human labour plus human creativity. All the value created by human labour and human creativity foundationally belongs to those who generate and deploy it, for them to exchange and gift as they see fit. But natural wealth foundationally belongs to us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This principle lights the path towards the elimination of abject poverty, not just through charity or economic development, but also through the acknowledgement that no matter what, every human being has the basic right to a share of the sustenance provided by our earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crucially, while most proposals for Universal Basic Income face legitimate criticism regarding their economic logic and economically distorting side effects, the DCO transforms the field by balancing many underlying dynamics to create the rock solid economic reference point of credcoin. Instead of having a distorting impact on economic activity, by staying focused on the right to one equal share and the obligation to provide market value for consumption, the DCO stabilizes on deeply free-market forces and values while providing a basic, poverty-fighting, humanity-respecting income stream to all.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Victory over war</h2>
      <p>
        Implemented at scale, the credcoin principle transforms geopolitical realities, and the very fabric of war and conflict. When the value of natural resources is shared equally by all, from rights auctioned on an open and free market, the logic fueling resource conflict simply disappears. The credcoin principle, by its very existence, undercuts one of the main drivers of war, directly replacing it with a just, compassionate, democratic and ruthlessly effective market dynamic. In this way, your participation in the DCO literally and directly relieves pressure on geopolitical hotspots, by adding your own energy to this transformational momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem also offers the opportunity to experiment with a new kind of governance that arises from a fundamentally non-coercive foundation based on universal human sovereignty. This structure can exist in supportive harmony with all existing regulatory powers and governance structures, but it is also fundamentally independent of them. By trailblazing a path in freedom-respecting, sustainability-supporting, market-harmonized, wealth-enabling, democratic governance, we undercut the forces of violence and aggression everywhere.
