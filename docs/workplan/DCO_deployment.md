# DCO Deployment Workplan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the process for automating infrastructure updates and redeployments as part of the Daily Credcoin Offering (DCO) process. The goal is to ensure that our infrastructure remains up-to-date while minimizing disruption to our services and maintaining data integrity.

## 2. Process Flow

1. The existing DailyCredcoinOffering cronjob will be extended to include infrastructure update checks and deployments.
2. Before running the DCO, the system will check for any external or internal changes that require infrastructure updates.
3. If changes are detected, the system will initiate the appropriate redeployment processes.
4. Special handling will be implemented for database redeployments to ensure data integrity.
5. After successful updates (if any), the DCO process will proceed as usual.

## 3. Detecting Changes

### 3.1 External Changes

To detect external changes, implement a function that checks for:

- New AMI versions for Neo4j or other services
- Updates to dependent services or libraries
- Changes in AWS service offerings that affect our infrastructure

Implementation:
```python
def check_external_changes():
    changes = []
    
    # Check for new Neo4j AMI
    current_ami = get_current_neo4j_ami_id()
    latest_ami = get_latest_neo4j_ami_id()
    if current_ami != latest_ami:
        changes.append(("neo4j_ami", latest_ami))
    
    # Add more checks for other external dependencies
    
    return changes
```

### 3.2 Internal Changes

To detect internal changes, implement a function that checks for:

- Updates to main.tf or associated Terraform files
- Changes in application code that require infrastructure updates

Implementation:
```python
def check_internal_changes():
    changes = []
    
    # Check for changes in Terraform files
    if terraform_files_changed():
        changes.append("terraform_config")
    
    # Check for changes in application code
    if application_code_changed():
        changes.append("application_code")
    
    return changes
```

## 4. Redeployment Process

### 4.1 General Infrastructure Updates

For non-database infrastructure updates:

1. Apply Terraform changes using `terraform apply`
2. Update ECS task definitions and services
3. Perform rolling updates of ECS services to minimize downtime

### 4.2 Database Redeployment

For Neo4j database redeployments:

1. Create new Neo4j instances with updated configurations
2. Perform a backup of the existing databases
3. Restore data to the new instances
4. Validate data integrity in the new instances
5. Update connection strings in the application configuration
6. Switch traffic to the new instances
7. Terminate old instances after a successful transition

Implementation:
```python
def redeploy_databases(changes):
    if "neo4j_ami" in [c[0] for c in changes]:
        new_ami_id = next(c[1] for c in changes if c[0] == "neo4j_ami")
        
        # Create new instances
        new_instances = create_new_neo4j_instances(new_ami_id)
        
        # Backup existing data
        backup_neo4j_data()
        
        # Restore data to new instances
        restore_neo4j_data(new_instances)
        
        # Validate data
        if validate_neo4j_data(new_instances):
            # Update application configuration
            update_neo4j_connection_strings(new_instances)
            
            # Switch traffic
            switch_traffic_to_new_instances(new_instances)
            
            # Terminate old instances
            terminate_old_neo4j_instances()
        else:
            # Handle validation failure
            rollback_neo4j_deployment()
```

## 5. Integration with DailyCredcoinOffering

Modify the DailyCredcoinOffering cronjob to include the infrastructure update checks:

```python
def daily_credcoin_offering():
    # Check for changes
    external_changes = check_external_changes()
    internal_changes = check_internal_changes()
    
    if external_changes or internal_changes:
        # Perform general infrastructure updates
        apply_infrastructure_updates(external_changes + internal_changes)
        
        # Handle database redeployments if necessary
        redeploy_databases(external_changes)
    
    # Proceed with regular DCO process
    perform_dco()
```

## 6. Pros and Cons of This Approach

### Pros:
1. Utilizes existing cronjob, reducing the need for additional scheduled tasks
2. Combines infrastructure updates with regular business processes, ensuring timely updates
3. Allows for fine-grained control over which changes trigger redeployments
4. Maintains data integrity by carefully handling database redeployments
5. Minimizes downtime by using rolling updates and blue-green deployments

### Cons:
1. Increases complexity of the DCO process
2. May extend the duration of the DCO process when updates are required
3. Requires careful error handling to prevent issues with the DCO if infrastructure updates fail
4. May require additional computational resources during update processes

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring:

1. Log all detected changes and update processes
2. Set up alerts for failed updates or prolonged update processes
3. Monitor system performance during and after updates
4. Implement a dashboard for visualizing the status of infrastructure components

## 8. Rollback Procedures

Develop and document rollback procedures for each type of update:

1. For non-database updates, maintain the ability to revert to the previous Terraform state
2. For database updates, keep the old instances running until the new ones are fully validated
3. Implement automated rollback triggers based on predefined criteria (e.g., failed health checks)

## 9. Testing and Validation

1. Develop a comprehensive test suite for the update detection and deployment processes
2. Create a staging environment that mirrors production for testing updates
3. Implement canary deployments for gradual rollout of changes
4. Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure rollback procedures are effective

## 10. Documentation and Training

1. Maintain up-to-date documentation of the entire process
2. Provide training for the operations team on handling manual interventions if needed
3. Establish a change management process for reviewing and approving infrastructure updates

## 11. Future Improvements

1. Implement machine learning algorithms to predict optimal times for updates based on system load
2. Develop a self-healing system that can automatically address common infrastructure issues
3. Explore containerization of Neo4j databases for easier management and updates

By following this workplan, we can ensure that our infrastructure remains up-to-date and secure while minimizing disruption to our services and maintaining data integrity.
