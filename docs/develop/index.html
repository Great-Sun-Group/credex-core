    <h1>
      Developer Documentation<br />
      for the credex-core API
    </h1>

    <p>
      The documentation accessible in the Developer Guides section of the menu
      covers all the details of developing, testing and deploying the
      credex-core codebase.
    </p>

    <h2>Neo4j Databases</h2>
    <p>
      Credex-core runs on two neo4j databases. LedgerSpace is the shared ledger
      containing the full state of the credex ecosystem. SearchSpace contains
      only unredeemed credexes, and is optimized to find credloops. On every
      credloop found and cleared, LedgerSpace is updated accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>Express.js Server</h2>
    <p>
      The express.js server is initialized in <code>src/index.ts</code>, which
      provides the cronjobs and endpoints that power the ecosystem and enable
      members and client apps to interact with its ledger, locking in the
      security and authorization, as well as parsing, logging, and other
      middleware.
    </p>

    <h3>Cronjobs</h3>
    <p>The src/core-cron/ module hosts the cronjobs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="../full-audit/DCO.html">DailyCredcoinOffering</a> runs every
        day at midnight UTC, calculating the value of 1 CXX and updating all
        ecosystem values accordingly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="../full-audit/MTQ.html">MinuteTransactionQueue</a> runs every
        minute, clearing credloops of value creation across the ecosystem.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Endpoints</h3>
    <p>
      Endpoints and routes are deployed for the modules: Member, Account,
      Credex, Avatar, and Admin. Endpoints for the DevAdmin module are included
      in development and staging deployments, but not in production.
    </p>

    <h2>Deployment Process</h2>
    <p>
      The credex-core application is deployed using AWS services (including ECS,
      ECR), Terraform for infrastructure management, and GitHub Actions for
      CI/CD. The application relies on Neo4j Enterprise Edition for data storage
      and management. The deployment process runs in three separate workflows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="../develop/deployment/connectors_workflow.html"
          >connectors.yml</a
        >: Handles the deployment of infrequently changed infrastructure such as
        clusters and load balancers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="../develop/deployment/databases_workflow.html">databases.yml</a
        >: Sets up and manages Neo4j database resources (ledgerSpace and
        searchSpace).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="../develop/deployment/app_workflow.html">app.yml</a>: Deploys
        the application itself (and these docs).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This separation allows for granular control over each part of the
      deployment process and makes it easier to manage and troubleshoot specific
      aspects of the deployment. Environment is determined at run time by which
      branch the workflow is run on, enabling same workflow files to manage all
      environments.
    </p>

    <h2>CI/CD Pipeline Environments</h2>
    <p>
      Configuration for all environments is outlined in
      <a href="environment_setup.html">Environment Setup</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Local</h3>
    <p>
      A local environment is supplied by a developer's own machine or a virtual
      Github Codespaces machine, and linked cloud-deployed instances of neo4j
      (Neo4j Aura). Testing in this environment ensures that all endpoints
      return data as expected. The value of the environment variable in this
      deployment is <code>development</code>, like the first deployed
      environment below.
    </p>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>development</code> environment and databases are intended to
      provide initial deployment testing on isolated data in dev DBs by
      manually-triggered deployment off the <code>dev</code> branch using Github
      Workflows. This testing includes data integrity checks across larger data
      sets and mutiple DCO exchange rate updates.
    </p>

    <h3>Staging</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>staging</code> environment and databases are intended to provide
      production-scale testing in a mock production environment, and are
      deployed and tested automatically by pushes to the
      <code>stage</code> branch. When triggered, the deployment of the staging
      environment includes the full deployment of production-scale infrastructor
      (connectors, databases, application), automatic performance testing on
      production-scale data sets, spot checks for data integrity, and full
      deployment tear-down when tests are passed to satisfaction. Scale tests
      bypass the HTTPS protocols, running fully internal to the server. This
      environment can also mimic the update of deployed neo4j infrastructure.
      (Not yet true, still manually deployed from <code>stage</code> branch and
      no large scale test, tear-down, or DB deploy/update scripts written.)
    </p>

    <h3>Production</h3>
    <p>
      The <code>production</code> environment enables members to interact with
      the production databases that host the live ledger of the credex
      ecosystem. This environment automatically redeploys the app by running the
      application workflow every day just after midnight UTC at the end of the
      DCO. (Not yet true, still manually deployed from
      <code>prod</code> branch). Updates to the underlying database or
      connectors infrastructure are manually deployed from the
      <code>prod</code> branch using Github Workflows (behaviour intended to
      remain).
