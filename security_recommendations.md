# Security Recommendations

Based on the code review for security best practices, here are the key recommendations:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication checks in all controllers handling sensitive operations.
   - Ensure only authorized users can access all endpoints.

2. **Input Handling**
   - Implement input sanitization in addition to existing validation.

3. **Secure Communication**
   - Use HTTPS in all environments, especially production.
   - Implement CORS policies to restrict API access.

4. **Security Headers**
   - Add security headers to all responses (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy).

5. **CSRF Protection**
   - Implement CSRF protection for endpoints accessed via web interfaces.

6. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement per-user rate limiting for sensitive operations.

7. **Database Security**
   - Ensure all database queries use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

8.  **JWT Handling**
    - Implement a refresh token mechanism for better user experience without compromising security.
