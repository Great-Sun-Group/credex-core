### 2. Create System Architecture Documentation
```markdown
# System Architecture

## Overview
The ID verification system is built using a microservices architecture, leveraging AWS services for scalability and security.

## Components

### 1. API Layer
- Express.js REST API
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Request validation and sanitization
- Load balancing through AWS ELB

### 2. Processing Layer
- AWS Rekognition for face comparison
- Image quality validation service
- ID document processing service
- Fraud detection service

### 3. Storage Layer
- S3 for photo storage
- DynamoDB for verification records
- CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- KMS for encryption keys

### 4. Security Layer
- IAM roles and policies
- API authentication
- Data encryption
- Audit logging

## Data Flow
1. Client submits photos through API
2. Photos validated and stored in S3
3. Processing services analyze photos
4. Results stored and returned to client

## Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling of API servers
- Auto-scaling groups for processing
- DynamoDB on-demand capacity
- S3 with CloudFront CDN

## Monitoring
- CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Custom dashboard for key metrics
- Alert configuration
- Performance monitoring
```

### 3. Create User Guides
```markdown
# User Guide: ID Verification System

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Valid government-issued ID
- Smartphone with camera
- Good lighting conditions
- Stable internet connection

### Photo Requirements
1. ID Document Photo
   - Clear, unobstructed view
   - All corners visible
   - No glare or shadows
   - Minimum resolution: 640x480

2. Selfie Photo
   - Well-lit, front-facing
   - Neutral expression
   - Clear face visibility
   - No sunglasses or hats

### Verification Process
1. Launch the verification system
2. Select "Start Verification"
3. Upload ID document photo
4. Take selfie photo
5. Submit for verification
6. Wait for results

### Common Issues
1. Photo Quality
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Hold camera steady
   - Follow framing guidelines

2. Technical Issues

```

### 4. Create Error Catalog
```markdown
# Error Message Catalog

## API Errors

### 400 Series (Client Errors)
- ERR_400_001: Invalid file format
  - Cause: Uploaded file is not JPG/PNG
  - Resolution: Convert file to supported format

- ERR_400_002: File too large
  - Cause: File exceeds 5MB limit
  - Resolution: Compress image or reduce resolution

- ERR_400_003: Low resolution

  - Cause: Internal service error
  - Resolution: Contact support

- ERR_500_002: Storage error
  - Cause: S3 upload failed
  - Resolution: Retry upload

## Verification Errors

### Quality Errors
- ERR_QUAL_001: Blurry image
  - Cause: Camera movement
  - Resolution: Hold camera steady

- ERR_QUAL_002: Poor lighting
  - Cause: Insufficient light
  - Resolution: Move to well-lit area

### Face Matching Errors
- ERR_FACE_001: No face detected
  - Cause: Face not visible
  - Resolution: Ensure face is clearly visible

- ERR_FACE_002: Multiple faces
