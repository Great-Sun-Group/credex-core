      <h2>Sovereign natural resources</h2>
      <p>
        Our earth is bountiful, and finite. Our ecosystem is resilient, and
        fragile. We are capable of destroying our habitat, and we've done a lot
        of that. We are also capable of nurturing our habitat, and we've done a
        lot of that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impulse for human sovereignty cannot be separated from the impulse
        to sustain humanity, civilization, and the biosphere for the long term.
        We belong here, and we are responsible for our actions. We respect the
        sovereignty of future generations of humanity and we value the natural
        world in itself. Destroying our habitat at scale is simply not an
        option. So let's stop. It may be easier than we think.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take personal responsibility for this Earth that we belong to, and
        that belongs to us. Our purpose is to sustain a bountiful biosphere and
        human economy in the present and into the indefinite future.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The truth about limits</h2>
      <p>
        The starting point is simply to acknowledge the truth that there are
        limits to the natural resources that can be sustainably harvested from
        the earth and the biosphere, and there are limits to the wastes that can
        be sustainably released. Infinite growth in resource consumption is a
        non-negotiable impossibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our earth is bountiful and has nurtured us since our primal origins.
        Natural resources are limited, but within these limits exists a
        sustainable harvest, and within our economy are flows, processes,
        patterns, and practices occurring in sustainable balance with the
        natural world at a fundamental level. There are literally infinite
        wealth-creating opportunities within these sustainable flows. Endless
        economic growth is possible, but only if we stabilize on a sustainable
        resource harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is critically important that we separate the non-negotiable fact that
        there are limits to sustainable resource harvests, from all opinions
        about what those limits should be, or who should decide. Reasonable
        people will differ. Facing those differences can come later. A shared
        starting point is far more important. And the farther we can extend
        together from that shared starting point, the stronger will be our
        chances of overcoming the differences when they arise.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Growth within limits</h2>
      <p>
        Our shared starting point here is an acknowledgement that although we
        can have perpetual growth in the circulation of economic value, we
        cannot have perpetual growth in resource consumption. The latter is a
        physical and logical impossibility. These are the truths that must be
        faced, and we have to take personal economic responsibility for facing
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, perpetual economic growth only becomes possible when we
        stabilize our resource consumption. Perpetual economic growth can only
        occur within the environment of a healthy and productive biosphere. A
        devastated biosphere will not support a thriving human economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we take personal responsibility for guiding our own resource
        consumption towards sustainable limits, we also open the door to
        personal participation in the infinite economic growth that is possible
        within those limits. Human creativity, ingenuity, and innovation is
        limitless, and economic value is always relative. This enables
        theoretically perpetual growth in the circulation of economic value and
        economic wealth, but only when harnessed within the limits of
        sustainability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sustainable consumption</h2>
      <p>
        We are beings who necessarily consume. But by containing our consumption
        and waste in some ways, and by nurturing the biosphere, we can actually
        increase the flow of sustainable human consumption and at the same time
        we can increase the wealth of life on earth as a whole. With this kind
        of stewardship, our Earth will reward us with bountiful harvests.
        Failing at this stewardship, we will sooner or later be rewarded with
        famines.
      </p>

      <h3>Belonging: one equal share</h3>
      <p>
        The organic economy is a subset of the global economy in which value
        circulates in resonance with biological processes. The organic economy
        is founded on the sustainable global harvest of natural resources, and
        grows richly from there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day, a sustainable harvest of natural resources enters the organic
        economy. This sustainable harvest is hidden among many unsustainable
        practices and products, but it's always there. Like this harvest, the
        organic economy itself is currently hidden, but always present.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are a sovereign human who belongs on this earth. Your birthright is
        one equal share of the natural resources entering the organic economy
        today.
      </p>

      <h3>Responsibility: provide value for consumption</h3>
      <p>
        We cannot have sovereignty and belonging without responsibility. We are
        responsible to provide value for the natural resources that we ourselves
        consume.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we provide market value to all in exchange for the natural
        resources that we use, we bring our personal consumption into the
        organic economy. When we step into this belonging and responsibility, we
        take our personal human sovereignty to a far deeper and more potent
        level. And when we step into this belonging and responsibility, we also
        tap into the perpetual wealth-creation opportunities of an economy
        operating in harmony with the biosphere.
      </p>

      <h3>Credcoin Principle:</h3>
      <h3 class="big-words">
        I am entitled to receive one equal share<br />
        of the value our economy harvests from nature.<br /><br />
        I am responsible to pay for the share<br />
        of natural wealth that I consume.
      </h3>
      <p>
        This core moral truth is the heartstone of credcoin, of the organic
        economy, and of the credex ecosystem. This truth is our primary economic
        reference point.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Daily Credcoin Offering</h2>
      <p>
        The credcoin principle is actualized every 24 hours in the daily
        credcoin offering (DCO). The daily cadence of the DCO is the heartbeat
        of the primary circulation system of the organic economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your voluntary participation in the DCO transforms the credcoin
        principle from moral idea to physical reality. The DCO occurs in the
        credex ecosystem at midnight UTC, and establishes the relative values of
        the denominations in the ecosystem for the next 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the DCO, the concept of the worldwide organic economy and the natural
        resource flows that sustain it becomes a real, measured flow of value
        among real humans. In the DCO we shift our focus away from "the organic
        economy" as an abstract concept of a portion of the economy that is
        invisible around us, and place our attention on a real, measured flow of
        natural resources.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Starting small</h2>
      <p>
        Without this granular focus, we are paralyzed by the vastness and
        pervasiveness of the problem of unsustainability. But by anchoring on a
        real and measurable flow of value, however small, the DCO enables us to
        collectively crystalize and start to measure what we know to be an
        insignificantly tiny portion of the full organic economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This real, actual, measurable organic economy based on real flows of
        values is insignificantly tiny compared to the fully grown and
        manifested organic economy in the same way that a redwood seed is
        insignificantly tiny in comparison to the royal old grandparent of the
        forest it may become.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can approach the concrete, measurable flows of the organic economy
        which is centred in the DCO and founded on credcoin as if it were the
        seed of the idealized concept of the totality of the organic economic
        flows across the Earth. If we nurture the seed of the concrete existence
        of this much larger concept, the seed will grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        But at the same time, it will never be more perfect or complete than it
        is right now. A seed is not less of a tree than sapling, which is not
        less of a tree than a giant. It is not less of a tree, it is just
        smaller in measure. The seed and the giant both contain the full essence
        of the tree. Through this lens, we can respect the fact that this
        organic economy seed will grow to something far vaster than what we
        measure today, yet we can also know that what we measure today is in its
        essence no less of the organic economy than it will be when the value
        measured is vastly greater.
      </p>
      <p>
        That may sound like some kind of spiritual statement, and I guess in a
        way it is, but it's actually describing a specific mathematical reality
        that is embedded in the credcoin principle itself, and its execution in
        the DCO.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Moral choice</h2>
      <p>
        Your voluntary participation in the gift and market portions of the DCO
        is a personal decision to bring your own consumption within the real,
        actual, measured seed of the growing organic economy. It's a decision to
        add some of your personal economic energy into this circulation system.
        It is a personal decision to advance the values of sovereignty, freedom,
        sustainability, mutual wealth creation, and economic justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DCO is fundamentally non-coercive, enabling you to embody your
        values without requiring the rest of the world to change. You stand as
        an example of what is possible, and you create positive change from that
        place of strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your participation in the DCO crystalizes the credcoin principle into
        the concrete value of the credcoin (CXX) denomination within the credex
        ecosystem, onto which all other values are anchored.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        In the DCO, each participant's responsibility to provide value for
        resource consumption is enacted starting in very simple ways. This value
        provided by participants establishes the total value of the natural
        wealth entering the (measured) organic economy today. By dividing this
        amount by the number of DCO participants, we establish the value of
        1.000 CXX for the next 24 hours. The DCO strategically and effectively
        processes the payments enacted by these calculations in currency,
        credex, and credcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a DCO participant, every day you fulfill your responsibility to
        provide value to all for your consumption of natural resources, and
        1.000 CXX is deposited to your credex account. This DCO credex delivers
        your daily birthright claim to one equal share of the natural wealth
        entering the organic economy today.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you consume more than one equal share of natural resources, your
        higher consumption is balanced and fairly compensated for when you
        distribute more value to all in the DCO than you receive in your 1.000
        CXX deposit. If you consume less than one equal share of resources, the
        1.000 CXX deposit to your account is of greater value than what you
        distribute to all through the DCO due to your consumption.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The credcoin equation</h2>
      <p>
        The credcoin principle can be translated into an equation, which the DCO
        executes and solves every 24 hours:
      </p>
      <p>
        The total value of the natural wealth entering the organic economy today
        divided by the number of members participating in the daily credcoin
        offering today equals one credcoin today.
      </p>
      <p>Expressed mathematically:</p>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          <div class="fraction">
            <div class="numerator">total value</div>
            <div class="denominator"># participants</div>
          </div>
          = 1.000 CXX
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gift and market</h2>
      <p>
        The total value of the natural wealth entering the organic economy is
        separated into two components: gift DCO and market DCO. The gift DCO
        taps into the primal generosity of humans to advance the causes of
        sovereignty, freedom and sustainability. The market DCO channels the
        primal self-centeredness of humans towards exactly the same ends, which
        ennobles price-based decision making across the entire organic economy
        by incorporating the full costs of natural resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simplifying the equation one final step, let the total value be
        separated into gift (G) and market (M) components, and let P equal the
        number of participants:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          <div class="fraction">
            <div class="numerator">G + M</div>
            <div class="denominator">p</div>
          </div>
          = 1.000 CXX
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Initialization</h2>
      <p>
        The DCO transfers real economic values (currency), and promises to
        provide real economic values (credexes), and it measures these flows of
        value. With these measurements, the credcoin equation can be solved for
        the day, linking the denomination of credcoin to currency values with a
        daily exchange rate. Using that exchange rate, all prices anywhere can
        be expressed in credcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        To initialize the flow of value and solve the equation in the first DCO,
        the value of 1.000 CXX had to be set arbitrarily, and was pegged to
        $1.00 CAD (Canadian dollars) on ecosystem launch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Midnight UTC was chosen as a temporal daily reference point for the DCO
        because it lies between close of business on one day and opening of
        business on the next across the majority of the population centres of
        the world, while the sun is high in the sky over the vast Pacific Ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since ecosystem launch, the value of CXX has floated based fully on DCO
        participant gifts, to which market DCO values will eventually be added.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Example calculation</h2>
      <p>
        At the close of a day on which 1.000 CXX has been worth $1.00, and there
        are two participants in the day-closing DCO, Alice giving $1.20 (1.200
        CXX) and Bob giving $0.90 (0.900 CXX), the equation will be solved like
        this:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          <div class="fraction">
            <div class="numerator">G + M</div>
            <div class="denominator">p</div>
          </div>
          = 1.000 CXX
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          <div class="fraction">

            <div class="denominator">2</div>
          </div>
          = 1.000 CXX
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          <div class="fraction">
            <div class="numerator">$2.10</div>
            <div class="denominator">2</div>
          </div>
          = 1.000 CXX
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          $1.05
          = 1.000 CXX
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        For the next twenty four hours, 1.000 CXX will be worth $1.05. Alice
        gave $1.20 and Bob gave $0.90, and each received a credex of 1.000 CXX,
        worth $1.05 and backed by the currency each has given.
