# Neo4j Monitoring and Maintenance

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for monitoring Neo4j instances and maintaining the Neo4j deployment across our development, staging, and production environments.

## Monitoring

### 1. Instance Health Checks

- Set up AWS CloudWatch alarms for:
  - CPU Utilization
  - Memory Usage
  - Disk Space
  - Network In/Out

- Configure alerts to notify the operations team when thresholds are exceeded.

### 2. Neo4j Specific Metrics

- Use Neo4j's built-in monitoring capabilities:
  - Enable JMX monitoring
  - Configure Neo4j to expose metrics to Prometheus

- Key metrics to monitor:
  - Active transactions
  - Cache hit ratio
  - Page cache usage
  - Heap memory usage
  - GC pause time

### 3. Log Monitoring

- Set up log aggregation using AWS CloudWatch Logs
- Create log filters and metrics to detect:
  - Error messages
  - Slow queries
  - Authentication failures

### 4. License Monitoring

- Set up a scheduled task to check the license expiration date
- Configure an alert to notify the team 30 days before license expiration

## Maintenance Procedures

### 1. Regular Backups

- Configure daily backups of Neo4j data
- Store backups in a separate AWS S3 bucket
- Regularly test the restore process

### 2. Version Updates

- Keep track of Neo4j version releases
- Test new versions in the development environment before upgrading staging and production
- Schedule version updates during off-peak hours

### 3. Performance Tuning

- Regularly review and optimize Neo4j configuration
- Analyze slow query logs and optimize frequently used queries
- Monitor and adjust instance sizes based on usage patterns

### 4. Security Updates

- Regularly apply security patches
- Review and update security groups and network access rules
- Rotate credentials periodically

## Incident Response

1. Set up an on-call rotation for the operations team
2. Define severity levels for different types of incidents
3. Create playbooks for common issues:
   - Instance unresponsive
   - High CPU/Memory usage
   - Data inconsistency
   - License expiration

## Reporting

- Generate weekly reports on:
  - Instance performance
  - Query performance
  - Error rates
  - Backup status

- Conduct monthly reviews of the monitoring and maintenance procedures

## Tools

- AWS CloudWatch
- Prometheus
- Grafana (for visualization)
- Neo4j Browser (for ad-hoc queries and monitoring)

Remember to regularly review and update these procedures as the system evolves and new requirements emerge.
