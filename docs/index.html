    <h3 class="subtitle">Our portal to the credex ecosystem</h3>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem is a shared ledger that enables the efficient
      circulation of value, accumulation of capital, investment of profits, and
      giving of gifts. Credex is a tool for financial inclusion, financial
      empowerment, and financial sovereignty.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex-core API deployed at mycredex.app is the portal through which
      members access their sovereign financial rights on the shared ledger and
      sidestep the economic distortions and extortions imposed by obsolete and
      destructive monetary paradigms.
    </p>

    <p>
      This API is the core interface that connects members to their data in the
      credex ecosystem. The processes of creating an account, logging in,
      arranging queries for the API endpoints, and processing query results for
      human-friendly presentation and interaction is managed by a client app
      such as the <a href="https://vimbisopay.co.zw">VimbisoPay</a> WhatsApp
      chatbot client.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose and Offering</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of the credex ecosystem is to distribute a political
      architecture based on the entitlements and responsibilities of universal
      human sovereignty. This distributed architecture is designed to open space
      for a market economy of cooperative wealth creation and value circulation
      in long-term harmony with our biosphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, in order to help every sovereign human live in freedom,
      justice, and prosperity, with the aspiration that we grow into our
      potential as a multiplanetary, multidimensional and spiritually mature
      global civilization, we offer the credex ecosystem for the benefit of all
      beings.
    </p>

    <h2>Credex Principle</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle2">
      If I owe you,<br />
      and you owe them,<br />
      and they owe me,<br />
      we're square.
    </h3>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem actualizes the Credex Principle in the Minute
      Transaction Queue (MTQ), which tracks payable and receivable invoices for
      members' accounts, finds loops of value creation, and cancels payable and
      receivable invoices against each other in "credloops" in which every debt
      is reduced by an equal value. This is a GAAP-compliant accounting
      procedure that anyone and any business can benefit from.
    </p>

    <p>
      In accounting terms, an outstanding credex is a contingent asset for one
      party and a contingent liability for the other. These asset/liability
      pairs are automatically strung together into credloops wherever possible
      across the credex ecosystem. When a credloop is found and cleared, every
      account in the loop will have an accounts payable invoice cleared against
      an equivalent accounts receivable invoice.
    </p>

    <p>
      This behaviour enables members to replace the use of third party money or
      other debt instruments that are issued by an outside sovereign with
      accounting entries on a shared ledger that are backed only by the credit,
      assets, and value-producing capacities of the transacting members.
    </p>

    <h3>Credex Services</h3>
    <p>
      The credex ecosystem provides the non-sovereign and non-monetary services
      of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Verifying the identity of the sovereign human counterparties and their
        corporations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Managing the technical verification and standardization of the credex
        transaction contract between the counterparties by providing templates
        that include conditions for fulfillment, default, and other states, and
        actions executed on each condition or state change.
      </li>
      <li>
        Executing these credex smart contracts according to the terms agreed by
        the counterparties, including triggering the agreed follow on actions
        dependent on the contract state and outcome.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These credex services empower a first layer of distributed financial
      sovereignty by enabling members to issue their own smart contracts. In so
      doing, we replace our reliance on the currencies of outside sovereigns and
      give ourselves options that insulate us from the financial dislocations of
      inflation and deflation in those currencies.
    </p>

    <h2>Credcoin Principle</h2>
    <h3 class="subtitle2">
      Every human is entitled to one equal share of<br />
      the value of the natural wealth entering the organic economy.<br /><br />
      Every human is responsible to provide value equal to<br />
      the amount of natural wealth that they consume.
    </h3>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem actualizes the Credcoin Principle in the Daily
      Credcoin Offering (DCO), which updates exchange rates across the ecosystem
      daily. Every 24h, the DCO makes this equation true: one credcoin today
      equals the number of members participating in the DCO today divided by the
      value of natural wealth entering the organic economy through the DCO
      today.
    </p>

    <p>
      The organic economy is a subset of the credex ecosystem, which is a subset
      of the global economy, which is the human-enhanced subset of the world
      that is given to us by nature. The organic economy is an economy in which
      wealth circulates, profit accumulates, investment is made, and gifts are
      given in alignment and long-term harmony with the biological environment
      of our habitat, the physical laws of our universe, and the spiritual laws
      of our existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem stores values in credcoin (CXX). In order to natively
      enable multi-denominational accounting, a CXXmultiplier value is stored
      alongside every CXX value. Both of these values are updated in every DCO
      so that the credex remains true both to the face value in the denomination
      specified, and to other values stored in the ecosystem. A value expressed
      in CXX is expressed in relation to every other value stored in the
      ecosystem. A CXX value can be divided by its CXX multiplier to express its
      face value.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem uses the flows of value that are created by members
      participating in the DCO as the anchor point for exchange rates across the
      ecosystem. These flows provide a daily peg that connects financial reality
      in the organic economy and the credex ecosystem as a whole to the reality
      of underlying natural resource flows, in a way that all other economic
      values can orient on. This mechanism manages the balance between local
      truth (preserving the face value of credex contracts in their specified
      denomination) and global truth (adjusting all values relative to credcoin)
      through the daily rate and value adjustments in the DCO.
    </p>

    <h3>Credcoin Services</h3>
    <p>
      The credex ecosystem provides the non-sovereign and non-monetary services
      of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Processing and distributing the daily flows of value that actualize the
        entitlements and responsibilities of the Credex Principle for
        participating sovereign members.
      </li>
      <li>
        Setting the relative values (exchange rates) of denominations in the
        ecosystem daily based on global market data including the real flows of
        value occuring in the DCO.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These credcoin services empower a second layer of distributed financial
      sovereignty by connecting every member to the underlying resource reality
      of their financial decisions, and relating every other measure of value
      all across the global economy to that underlying reality. In this way we
      replace our reliance on measures of value that are created and controlled
      by obsolete monetary paradigms with a measure of value that is
      structurally locked to the daily flows of real natural resources that
      sustain us.
    </p>

    <h2>Secured Credexes</h2>
    <p>
      The basic protocol underlying the credex ecosystem clears unsecured IOUs
      against each other. Overlaying this protocol is the protocol for secured
      credexes. A secured credex balance is created when a member purchases a
      secured credex from an authorized and audited account such as the ones
      managed by <a href="https://vimbisopay.co.zw">VimbisoPay</a> and
      <a href="https://greatsunfinancial.com">Great Sun Financial</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whereas unsecured credexes are based on pure peer-to-peer credit,
      accepting a secured credex provides the recipient assurances that the
      issuer has already provided an asset of real value that the recipient can
      now claim title to by virtue of accepting the secured credex. Secured
      credexes provide onramp/offramp services for cash in and cash out of the
      ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secured credexes are not produced internally by the credex ecosystem, nor
      does the credex ecosystem ever come into contact with money itself.
      Secured credexes exist in a one to one relationship with underlying assets
      held by third parties in audited accounts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Credex is a pure accounting platform that members can connect to real
      underlying assets by the purchase of secured credexes.
    </p>

    <h3>Secured Credex Services</h3>
    <p>
      The credex ecosystem provides the non-sovereign and non-monetary services
      of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Daily auditing of the trust accounts of secured credex agents like
        VimbisoPay and Great Sun Financial that are permitted to issue
        unrestricted secured credexes, ensuring the amount issued matches the
        amount of currency held.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only allowing accounts to issue secured credex in denominations and
        values that they have previously received into their account balances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Isolating secured credexes of each denomination into their own
        searchSpace substructure so that they only close against other secured
        credexes of the same denomination.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
    <p>
      These non-sovereign and non-monetary services provided by the credex
      ecosystem establish a network protocol that enables financial sovereignty
      for all:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Secured credex services enable members to base accounting entries on a
        trustworthy foundation of their real assets such as currency, with
        previous metals implementation coming in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unsecured credex services provide liquidity to meet all needs and fuel
        strong credit-based economic growth when conditions warrant, as
        determined by the distributed risk tolerance and risk/reward
        calculations of economic participants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credcoin services mathematically lock all values in the credex ecosystem
        to the market values of real natural resource flows, keeping the economy
        oriented on the most meaningful reference point possible without
        limiting systemic liquidity or personal choice.
      </li>
    </ul>
