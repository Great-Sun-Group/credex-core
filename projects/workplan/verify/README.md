## Branch Structure
- Main project branch: `verify-project`
- Individual task branches: Created from `verify-project` for each task
- Naming convention: `verify-{task-number}-{short-description}`

## Task Organization
Each task is designed to be:
- Self-contained and independently executable
- Completable within a single AI conversation context
- Documented with clear acceptance criteria
- Testable with specific test cases
- Mergeable back to the project branch

## Development Process
1. Create branch from `verify-project`
2. Follow task file instructions
3. Implement with AI assistance
4. Document changes
5. Run tests
6. Create merge request
7. Address review feedback

## Quality Standards
- All code must be properly tested
- Documentation must be complete and clear
- Security best practices must be followed
- Error handling must be comprehensive
- Performance considerations must be addressed

## Dependencies
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Node.js/Express.js environment
- Terraform installed
- Testing frameworks configured
- WhatsApp Business API access

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout `verify-project` branch
3. Select next task from pending list
4. Create your task branch
5. Follow the task file instructions
6. Use AI assistance for implementation
7. Submit merge request when complete

## Notes
- Tasks are designed to be executed sequentially
- Each task builds upon previous tasks
- Documentation is maintained throughout
- Security is considered at every step
