    <h2>What is Credcoin?</h2>

    <p>
      Credcoin (CXX) is the foundational measure of value within the credex
      ecosystem. Credcoin is a simple mathematical construct that translates a
      specific flow of natural resources (and changes in that flow) into a
      uniquely solid financial anchor point. Transactions in the credex
      ecosystem can be denominated in credcoin (CXX), and this denomination
      behaves in unique but predictable ways, inflationlessly anchored to a
      specific, real, and sustainable flow of natural resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Credcoin vs money</h2>

    <p>
      Credcoin (CXX) is a denomination that exists within the credex ecosystem
      and relies on its unique characteristics, anchoring every value in the
      ecosystem to the value of a real flow of natural wealth. Credex smart
      contracts could theoretically be implemented programmatically anchored in
      any currency or measure of value with reliable market rate data, or by
      enabling native behavior in every currency and adding an alternate
      implementation of exchange rate processes. However, we have chosen to
      establish CXX and utilize it as our base reference point because of its
      strengths:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Credcoin is connected to a real and sustainable flow of natural
        resources, anchoring our financial tokens to a specific and transparent
        economic reality and decoupling them from the fluctuations of currency
        denominations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credcoin offers stability of contracted value regardless of future
        fluctuations in the value of the flow of natural resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credcoin is an implementation of the Credcoin Principle (below), which
        we believe arises from and speaks to potent human impulses for
        self-sovereignty and sustainability.
      </li>
      <li>
        The principles behind this simple formula based denomination may be able
        to inspire a generation of innovation in formula and derivative based
        denominations within the credex ecosystem, perhaps opening evolutionary
        possibilities based on innovations that cannot now be even imagined.
      </li>
      <li>
        A single computational and conceptual anchor point for valuations has
        many additional practical, strategic, and systemic advantages.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We are unaware of any prior attempt at anything like credcoin, though the
      mathematics are simple and we believe it embodies principles that have
      been explored by many.
    </p>

    <h2>Organic economy</h2>

    <p>
      The organic economy is a subset of the global economy in which value is
      produced, circulated and consumed and in which capital is grown, invested
      and gifted, in harmony with the principles and processes of the natural
      world. We view the organic economy as a subset of the existing economy.
      But it currently exists only as a force and a potentiality. With credcoin
      we desire to cultivate and grow it from potential to embodied reality. The
      credex ecosystem is designed to bring the organic economy to our
      consciousness, enable its flows, and facilitate its growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further exploration of the organic economy is beyond the scope of this
      document, but its existence must be posited in order to understand the
      principle that lies at the heart of credcoin and therefore at the heart of
      the credex ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h2>Credcoin Principle</h2>

    <p>
      Every human being is entitled to one equal share of the natural wealth
      entering the organic economy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every human being is responsible to provide value equal to the amount of
      natural wealth that they consume.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credcoin principle can be translated into an equation, and solving the
      equation every 24 hours in the voluntary daily credcoin offering (DCO)
      gives us the daily value of 1.000 CXX vs currencies and vs the prior day.
      The value of one credcoin (1.000 CXX) is one equal share of the natural
      wealth entering the organic economy today.
    </p>

    <h3>Credcoin equation</h3>

    <div
      style="
        text-align: center;
        margin: 20px auto;
        max-width: 500px;
        padding: 20px;
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
      "
    >
      <div
        style="
          border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
          padding-bottom: 10px;
          margin-bottom: 10px;
        "
      >
        total value of the natural wealth<br />
        <u>entering the organic economy today</u><br />
        number of members participating in the DCO today
      </div>
      <div style="padding: 10px">= 1 Credcoin</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Let Credcoin equal CXX.<br />
      Let number of members equal M.<br />
      Let the total value of natural wealth be divided into two components:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Let G equal the total value of the natural wealth entering the organic
        economy today through gift-based DCO.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let P (for purchases) equal the total value of the natural wealth
        entering the organic economy today through market-based DCO.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Therefore, the credcoin equation is:</p>

    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 300px">
      <strong
        ><em><u>(G+P)</u></em></strong
      ><br />
      <strong><em>M</em></strong
      ><br />
      <strong><em>=</em></strong
      ><br />
      <strong><em>1.000 CXX</em></strong>
    </div>

    <h2>Decoupling</h2>

    <p>
      CXX is fully mathematical self-referential, just like modern money. This
      means that the two could exist with no relationship to each other. It is
      possible to envision a self contained CXX economy that has no exchange
      rate reference point to currency. Each of these mediums of exchange forms
      a mathematical system that can theoretically exist without the other, in a
      similar way that different denominations co-exist within the modern money
      system. Each theoretically could be run independently. The
      self-referential independence of CXX decouples it from modern money. This
      decoupling feature adds a deep layer of resiliency to the entire credex
      ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      From an investment point of view, this decoupling is a de-correlation of
      risk, which means that an investment in the organic economy is naturally
      hedged to some degree against systemic monetary dislocations. This feature
      could be used to offer smart contract solutions to countless investment
      markets. This de-correlation of risk is also an "operational hedge" for
      businesses and individuals, as it could provide a stream of income and
      temporary store of value that is unaffected (or less affected) by
      inflation and other monetary dislocations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every 24 hours, the DCO anchors the self-referential nature of credcoin
      firmly to the underlying economic, ecological and human reality. In this
      way, credcoin offers the unlimited leverage potential of the credex
      ecosystem, yet remains grounded in the natural world and real flows of
      value. Credcoin is decoupled from money and bound tightly to real value.
    </p>

    <h2>Mindshift</h2>

    <p>
      Perhaps the most profound, powerful, and hard to predict impact of an
      organic economy where value circulates aided by smart contracts
      denominated in CXX are the psychological impacts and potential for system
      wide behaviour changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Receiving one daily share of the natural wealth entering the organic
      economy and viewing all prices relative to that unit has a potentially
      transformative impact, especially if participants know that the sellers
      offering these prices have purchased the rights to utilize the natural
      resources consumed in their business, and the proceeds have been
      distributed to all.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that there is a potential positive self-referential feedback
      loop of mindshift, leading to behaviour shift, leading to greater
      mindshift, that opens completely new horizons of possibility for
      multigenerational prosperity.
    </p>

    <h2>DCO gifts</h2>

    <p>
      With the approach indicated above, the formation of specific DCO linked
      markets becomes possible. Their implementation and unification at scale is
      a massive project, perhaps unlike anything ever attempted, but launching
      the organic economy and the DCO does not depend on scale. It depends on
      participation, and a single participant is mathematically enough for
      continuity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gift portion of the DCO achieves two purposes. First, it enables an
      easier access point into the organic economy. A single human, or a handful
      of people can bring the organic economy to life with their participation
      in the DCO, and that participation only requires the giving of a small and
      low friction daily gift. These gifts form part of the DCO pool that is
      distributed as 1.000 CXX to all participants.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this mechanism, we strategically drop the systemic barrier to
      ecosystem launch to the lowest possible level, and align the organic
      economy with the deepest impulses of participants. If human beings want
      the organic economy to exist, we will breath life into it through our
      gifts, then we will build and strengthen the market infrastructure to
      scale it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second purpose of the gift portion of the DCO is to mathematically
      link the value of CXX to all currency and market values. The market
      portion of the DCO occurs completely in CXX, creating the self-referential
      resilience of the ecosystem. The gift portion of the DCO includes a gift
      of currency, and in so doing anchors the CXX exchange rates vs currency
      and all global markets.
    </p>

    <p>
      As gift participants in the DCO, we are gifting some of the value we have
      accumulated in the money economy into the organic economy in a very
      specific and generative way. We see this as moving the first small piece
      of our resource consumption into the organic economy. In doing this
      through the DCO, we distribute this value equally to all. In return we
      receive our own equal portion of the total value, and open our door to the
      organic economy. Here we can start to actively grow our own portion of the
      sustainable, multigenerational wealth that the credex ecosystem is
      designed to help each of us build.
    </p>

    <h2>Organic economy certification</h2>

    <p>
      The creation of DCO markets will go hand in hand with organic economy
      certification ratings providing information about the degree of organic
      economy activity embedded into every transaction. By participating in the
      DCO and accountably embedding organic economy values into the prices of
      their products and services, businesses will be able to access new markets
      made up of other nodes who also want to bring their consumption more into
      line with ecological principles, environmental sustainability, freedom,
      and self-sovereignty.
    </p>

    <h2>Regulation</h2>

    <p>
      Certification processes can be incredibly successful based on optional
      participation, whereas government regulations enforce participation and
      insist on 100% compliance. If you do not have a government approved
      commercial fishing license, you will be prevented from harvesting fish to
      sell.
    </p>

    <p>
      The organic economy and the resource flows entering it could be linked to
      government regulation and legislation this way. Some governments might be
      resistant to the principle of sharing the value of the natural resources
      harvested in their jurisdiction equally with all DCO participants rather
      than balancing their own budgets or distributing the value only to their
      own citizens. This resistance would be tempered by the equivalent flows of
      value that would flow into a jurisdiction from the participation in other
      regions. If this resistance could be overcome or accommodations made
      within the DCO process, governments could potentially utilize the DCO in
      their own policymaking, under conditions that benefit governments, their
      citizens, and members, and the whole ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem, credex, credcoin, and the organic economy do not
      require this kind of government involvement to function, but in the future
      the two could conceivably be linked.
    </p>

    <h2>Embed sustainability into prices</h2>

    <p>
      When businesses pay for the sustainable flow of natural resources that
      they require to deliver their products and services, their prices begin to
      have sustainability baked in. In this context, a premium will gradually
      start to build in the organic economy on products and services that
      consume more natural resources, with the value of that premium distributed
      to all DCO participants equally. In this way, value flows and capital
      creation is intentionally guided down the paths that require the fewest
      resources, as naturally as water flowing downhill. In this way, the
      organic economy integrates the forces of markets and capital with
      ecological forces and realities, and enables ecology and economy to grow
      wealth in reciprocal harmony. In this way, we make the sustainability
      premium something we can be proud to pay, knowing that it goes to all
      equally, directly, and daily, and that those who need it most receive the
      most benefit from this generative pattern.
    </p>

    <h2>Poverty alleviation</h2>

    <p>
      In this way, we offer each human being the birthright of at least a
      minimal flow of wealth to support basic human existence, and we offer the
      opportunity to cooperate directly with others to grow that flow into a
      pool, a stream, a river, or an ocean.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implemented at global scale, the DCO has the potential to alleviate the
      most extreme forms of poverty and raise the floor for material human
      existence everywhere. Money has nothing comparable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DCO could even be seen as a unique implementation of the principles of
      Universal Basic Income (UBI). Credcoin embeds the principles of human
      dignity and economic justice directly into our very medium of exchange,
      right alongside the values of sustainability and mutual prosperity.
      Furthermore, the DCO achieves all this in a way that provides an
      incomparably rock solid economic anchor point, rather than the economic
      distortion that critics of other UBI proposals fear.
    </p>

    <h2>Values</h2>

    <p>
      Voluntary participation of members and their businesses in the DCO centres
      the credex ecosystem and especially the denomination of credcoin firmly on
      the values of respect, freedom, diversity, sustainability, unity, personal
      sovereignty, and mutual prosperity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only core value that could be said to be similarly implemented in the
      rulesets of the money system is the value of individual prosperity via
      competitive profit that is embedded in the debt overhang of money
      economies.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem brings to life deep human values that money simply
      has no relationship with. Comparing credcoin to money with regards to the
      values embodied in their systemic rulesets leads to a clear conclusion.
      Credcoin is a medium of exchange and modern money is a medium of exchange,
      but credcoin is better in a deeply human-centric and earth-centric way.
