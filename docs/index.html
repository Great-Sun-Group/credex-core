    <h1>MyCredex.app</h1>
    <h3 class="subtitle">Our portal to the credex ecosystem</h3>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem is a shared ledger that enables the efficient
      circulation of value, accumulation of capital, investment of profits, and
      giving of gifts. Credex is a tool for financial inclusion, financial
      empowerment, and financial sovereignty.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/Great-Sun-Group/credex-core">
      credex-core API codebase</a> deployed at mycredex.app is the portal through which
      we access our sovereign financial rights on the shared ledger, and
      sidestep the economic distortions and extortions imposed by obsolete and
      destructive monetary paradigms.
    </p>

    <p>
      This API is the core interface that connects us to our data in the credex
      ecosystem. The processes of creating an account, logging in, arranging
      queries for the API endpoints, and processing query results for
      human-friendly presentation and interaction is managed by a client app
      such as the <a href="https://vimbisopay.co.zw">VimbisoPay</a> WhatsApp
      chatbot client.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose and Offering</h2>
    <p>
      Whereas the purpose of the credex ecosystem is to distribute a political
      architecture based on the entitlements and responsibilities of universal
      human sovereignty;
    </p>

    <p>
      And whereas this distributed architecture is designed to open a space
      for market economies of cooperative wealth creation and value circulation
      in long-term harmony with our biosphere;
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, desiring to help every sovereign human live in freedom,
      justice, and prosperity;
    </p>

    <p>
      And with the aspiration that we grow into our
      potential as a multi-planetary, multi-dimensional, and spiritually mature
      human civilization;
    </p>

    <p>
      We offer the credex ecosystem for the benefit of all beings.
    </p>

    <h2>Credex Principle</h2>
    <h3 class="big-words">
      If I owe you,<br />
      and you owe them,<br />
      and they owe me...<br />
      we're square.
    </h3>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem actualizes the Credex Principle in the Minute
      Transaction Queue (MTQ), which tracks payable and receivable invoices for
      members' accounts, finds loops of value creation, and cancels payable and
      receivable invoices against each other in <em>credloops</em> in which every debt
      is reduced by an equal value. This is a GAAP-compliant accounting
      procedure that anyone and any business can benefit from, anywhere in the
      world.
    </p>

    <p>
      In accounting terms, an outstanding credex is a contingent asset for one
      party and a contingent liability for the other. These asset/liability
      pairs are automatically strung together into credloops wherever possible
      across the credex ecosystem. When a credloop is found and cleared, every
      account in the loop will have an accounts payable invoice cleared against
      an equivalent accounts receivable invoice.
    </p>

    <p>
      This behaviour enables members to replace the use of third party money or
      other debt instruments that are issued by an outside sovereign with
      accounting entries on a shared ledger that are backed only by the
      sovereign credit, assets, and value-producing capacities of the
      transacting members.
    </p>

    <h3>Credex Services</h3>
    <p>
      The credex ecosystem provides the non-sovereign and non-monetary services
      of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Verifying the identity of the sovereign human counterparties and their
        corporations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Managing the technical verification and standardization of the credex
        invoice and contract between the counterparties by providing templates
        that include conditions for fulfillment, default, and other states, and
        actions executed on each condition or state change.
      </li>
      <li>
        Executing these credex smart contract invoices according to the terms agreed by
        the counterparties, including triggering the agreed follow on actions
        dependent on the invoice state and outcome.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These invoice clearing services of the MTQ 
      empower a first layer of distributed financial
      sovereignty by enabling us to issue our own customizable smart contracts. In so
      doing, we replace our reliance on the currencies of outside sovereigns and
      give ourselves options that insulate us from the financial dislocations of
      inflation and deflation in those currencies.
    </p>

    <h2>Credcoin Principle</h2>
    <h3 class="big-words">
      I am entitled to receive one equal share<br />
      of the value our economy harvests from nature.<br /><br />
      I am responsible to pay for the share<br />
      of natural wealth that I consume.
    </h3>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem actualizes the Credcoin Principle for participating
      members in the Daily Credcoin Offering (DCO), in a process which anchors 
      relative exchange rates across the ecosystem. Every 24h, the DCO makes this 
      equation true: one credcoin today equals the number of members participating 
      in the DCO today divided by the value of natural wealth entering the organic 
      economy through the DCO today.
    </p>

    <p>
      One credcoin is issued daily per DCO participant, each worth one equal
      share of the total value received in the DCO, which is paid in at market rates based
      on a participant's resource consumption relative to other participants.
      Those who consume more purchase that right fairly from those who consume
      less.
    </p>

    <p>
      The organic economy is a subset of the credex ecosystem, which is a subset
      of the global economy, which is a human-enhanced subset of the universe
      that is given to us by nature. The organic economy is an economy in which
      wealth circulates, profit accumulates, investment is made, and gifts are
      given in alignment and long-term harmony with the biological environment
      of our habitat, the physical laws of our universe, and the spiritual laws
      of our existence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem stores values in credcoin (CXX). In order to natively enable multi-denominational accounting, a CXXmultiplier value is stored alongside every CXX value. Both of these values are updated in every DCO so that all accounting and reporting remains universally true both to the face value in the denomination specified, and to all other values stored in the ecosystem. A contract expresses it's CXX value when it needs a reference vs any other value in the ecosystem. A contract expresses it's face value when it needs a reference vs the original intentions of the counterparties. On-the-fly exchange rate calculations performed on CXX values enable any amount to be viewed or totaled in the current or past value of any denomination at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem uses the flows of value that are created by members
      participating in the DCO as the anchor point for exchange rates across the
      ecosystem. These flows, which can be as small as a single member,
      provide a mathematical peg that anchors financial reality in the credex
      ecosystem to the reality of underlying natural resource flows.
    </p>

    <p>
      The multi-denominational mathematical mechanisms of the DCO manage the dynamic balance between:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local truth:</strong> preserving the value of all contracts in
        their specified denomination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Global truth:</strong> preserving the value of all contracts
        relative to every other value.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Past truth:</strong> preserving the value of past contracts
        relative to today's real resource flow values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future truth:</strong> preserving the value of all contracts
        independent of changing resource flow values.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Credcoin Services</h3>
    <p>
      The credex ecosystem provides the non-sovereign and non-monetary services
      of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Processing and distributing the daily flows of value that actualize the
        entitlements and responsibilities of the Credex Principle for
        participating sovereign members.
      </li>
      <li>
        Setting the relative values of all contracts in all denominations daily 
        by linking global market data to CXX through the real flows of value occuring 
        in the DCO.
      </li>
      <li>
        Establishing CXX as the first formula-based denomination of the credex ecosystem, 
        anchored on the rights and responsibilities of universal human sovereignty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Providing a container for other formulaic denominations and financial innovations
        designed by for-profit and non-profit corporations for their own purposes and reliably
        linked to real economic values through the process of the DCO.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These credcoin services empower a second layer of distributed financial
      sovereignty by connecting every member to the underlying resource reality
      of their financial decisions, and relating every other measure of value
      across the economy to that underlying reality. In this way we
      replace our reliance on measures of value that are created and controlled
      by obsolete monetary paradigms with a measure of value that is
      structurally locked to the daily flows of real natural resources that
      sustain us, while still empowering full flexibility for financial
      innovation and experimentation in the private sector.
    </p>

    <h2>Secured Credexes</h2>
    <p>
      The basic protocol underlying the credex ecosystem clears unsecured debts
      (invoices) against each other. Overlaying this protocol is the protocol
      for secured credexes. A secured credex balance is created when a member
      purchases a secured credex from an authorized and audited account such as
      the ones managed by <a href="https://vimbisopay.co.zw">VimbisoPay</a> and
      <a href="https://greatsunfinancial.com">Great Sun Financial</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whereas unsecured credexes are based on pure peer-to-peer credit,
      accepting a secured credex provides the recipient assurances that the
      issuer has already provided an asset of real value to an audited third party
      that the recipient can now claim title to at any time (via credloop) simply by issuing an invoice to the
      securing party. Secured credexes provide onramp/offramp services for cash
      in and cash out of the ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The credex ecosystem does not process currency, hold funds, or come into contact with money in any way. Secured credexes are not produced by the credex ecosystem. Credex is not money. Secured credexes exist in a one-to-one relationship with underlying assets held by <em>third parties</em> in audited bank accounts and vaults, where they securely and verifiably remain. 
    </p>

    <p>
      MyCredex.app provides moneyless accounting services, and as sovereign members we have come together to create a system that uses third-party verification to create accounting entries locked to real underlying assets.</p>

    <h3>Secured Credex Services</h3>
    <p>
      The credex ecosystem provides the non-sovereign and non-monetary services
      of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Daily auditing of the trust accounts of secured credex agents like
        VimbisoPay and Great Sun Financial that are permitted to issue
        unrestricted secured credexes, and ensuring the amount issued matches the
        amount of currency held.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only allowing unaudited accounts to issue secured credex in denominations and
        values that they have previously received into their account balances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Isolating secured credexes of each denomination into their own
        substructure so that they only close in loops with other secured
        credexes of the same denomination, ensuring that the link from real assets to secured balances remains intact and auditable.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
    <p>
      In summary, these non-sovereign and non-monetary accounting and data management services provided by the credex ecosystem establish a network protocol that empowers universal financial sovereignty.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Secured credex services enable members to base accounting entries on a trustworthy foundation of their real assets such as currency, with precious metals implementation coming in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unsecured credex services provide liquidity to meet all needs and fuel strong credit-based economic growth when conditions warrant, as determined by the distributed risk tolerance and risk/reward calculations of economic participants.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credcoin services mathematically lock all values in the credex ecosystem
        to the market values of real natural resource flows, keeping the economy
        oriented on the most meaningful reference point possible without
        limiting systemic liquidity, personal choice, or financial innovation.
      </li>
    </ul>
