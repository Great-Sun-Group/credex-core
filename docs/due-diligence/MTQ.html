    <h1 class="chapter-title">MinuteTransactionQueue (MTQ)</h1>

    <p>
      The Minute Transaction Queue (MTQ) is a crucial component of the Credex
      ecosystem that runs every minute. It links the main ledgerSpace database
      (the source of truth and full information) to a searchSpace database
      (optimized to find credloops). Every minute, first any new accounts are
      added to the searchSpace, then any new credexes. After each new credex is
      added, the ecosystem finds and clears all possible loops created by the
      new credex before moving on to the next.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Processing new accounts:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Finds accounts with "PENDING_ACCOUNT" status in the ledger space.
          </li>
          <li>Creates corresponding accounts in the search space.</li>
          <li>
            Updates the account status to "PROCESSED" in the ledger space.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Processing new Credexes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Retrieves Credexes with "PENDING_CREDEX" status from the ledger
            space.
          </li>
          <li>Sorts them by acceptance time.</li>
          <li>For each Credex, calls the LoopFinder function.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>LoopFinder.ts</h2>

    <p>
      The LoopFinder is a sophisticated component that handles both unsecured
      and secured credexes. It manages the creation, processing, and clearing of
      credex loops while maintaining data integrity across both the searchSpace
      and ledgerSpace databases.
    </p>

    <h3>Secured vs Unsecured Credexes</h3>
    <p>The system handles two types of credexes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Unsecured Credexes:</strong> Standard credexes with due dates
        that remain as specified.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secured Credexes:</strong> Special credexes that are secured
        against specific denominations. These are handled differently:
        <ul>
          <li>
            They use a special relationship type in the search space (e.g.,
            "USD_SECURED", "EUR_SECURED")
          </li>
          <li>Their due dates are automatically adjusted to the current day</li>
          <li>They maintain separate loop paths from unsecured credexes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Search Space Management</h3>
    <p>When a new credex is processed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The system first checks if the credex already exists in searchSpace (to
        handle previous errors).
      </li>
      <li>
        If not, it creates:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A new Credex node with properties including outstandingAmount,
            Denomination, CXXmultiplier, and dueDate
          </li>
          <li>
            Appropriate SEARCH_SECURED relationships linking the credex to its
            search anchor
          </li>
          <li>
            Search anchors that maintain the earliest due date among their
            connected credexes
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Graph representation of the search space structure:</p>
    <pre>
                                    Search Space Graph
                                    -----------------

    [Account A] ----UNSECURED/USD_SECURED----> [Search Anchor] ----UNSECURED/USD_SECURED----> [Account B]
                                                     ^
                                                     |
                                              SEARCH_SECURED
                                                     |
                                               [Credex Node]
                                             {credexID: "123",
                                              outstandingAmount: 100,
                                              Denomination: "USD",
                                              dueDate: "2024-01-01"}

    Properties:
    - Search Anchor: Maintains earliestDueDate among connected credexes
    - Relationship Types: Either UNSECURED or [DENOMINATION]_SECURED
    - Multiple credexes can connect to the same search anchor
    - Search anchors are created per relationship type between accounts

    Example Loop:
    [Account A] --USD_SECURED--> [Anchor 1] --USD_SECURED--> [Account B]
         ^                                                        |
         |                                                        |
         +------------------------USD_SECURED---------------------+
    </pre>

    <p>
      In the USD_SECURED example above, every outstanding secured USD credex
      between Account A and Account be is connected to Anchor 1. This optimizes
      the searchSpace for path traversing with no extraneous paths to match.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When there are no outstanding credexes of a specific type between two
        accounts, no searchAnchor exists for that type.
      </li>
      <li>When a credex of a type is created, the Search Anchor is created.</li>
      <li>
        Any subsequent credexes of that type between the accounts are attached
        to the same Search Anchor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Credexes are deleted when fully redeemed, and Anchors are deleted when
        all of their credexes are deleted, to be recreated later as needed.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Loop Finding Algorithm</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Loop Discovery:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Finds all loops starting and ending at the specified account
            (issuer)
          </li>
          <li>
            Uses type-specific paths (unsecured or denom-specific secured) based
            on the credex type
          </li>
          <li>Identifies the loop with nodes having the earliest due date</li>
          <li>
            For each node in the loop, selects the credex with the earliest due
            date (or largest amount if tied)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Loop Processing:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Identifies the minimum outstanding amount among all credexes in the
            loop
          </li>
          <li>Updates all credexes in the loop by subtracting this amount</li>
          <li>
            Tracks which credexes are fully redeemed (outstanding amount reaches
            zero)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Search Space Cleanup:
        <ul>
          <li>Removes fully redeemed credexes</li>
          <li>Updates earliest due dates on affected search anchors</li>
          <li>
            Removes orphaned search anchors (those with no remaining credexes)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Ledger Space Updates:
        <ul>
          <li>Creates a LoopAnchor node to represent the cleared loop</li>
          <li>
            Updates outstanding and redeemed amounts on all affected credexes
          </li>
          <li>
            Creates REDEEMED relationships between credexes and the loop anchor
          </li>
          <li>
            Creates CREDLOOP relationships between sequential credexes in the
            loop
          </li>
          <li>
            For fully redeemed credexes:
            <ul>
              <li>Replaces OWES relationships with CLEARED relationships</li>
              <li>Sets the DateRedeemed timestamp</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Error Handling and Logging</h3>
    <p>The system implements comprehensive error handling and logging:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All major operations are logged with appropriate context</li>
      <li>
        Errors are caught, logged with full stack traces, and handled gracefully
      </li>
      <li>
        Database sessions are properly managed and closed in finally blocks
      </li>
      <li>
        Failed operations are tracked and can be retried in subsequent runs
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This implementation actualizes the Credex Principle by finding loops where
      "If I owe you, and you owe them, and they owe me, we're square." It
      automatically clears these loops, reducing the outstanding amounts of all
      involved credexes by the same amount (the minimum amount in the loop). The
      system handles both unsecured and secured credexes appropriately,
      maintaining separate paths and applying different rules as needed.
