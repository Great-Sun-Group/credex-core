### DCO on Separate Instance Analysis

Running the DCO on a separate instance every 24 hours could potentially allow for reducing the size of the LedgerSpace instance. Here's an analysis of this approach:

1. **Separate DCO Instance**:
   - Instance Type: r5.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 128 GB RAM)
   - Usage: 4 hours per day
   - Monthly Cost: $360

2. **Reduced LedgerSpace Instance**:
   - Current: r5.12xlarge ($4,200/month)
   - Potential Reduction: r5.8xlarge ($2,800/month)
   - Monthly Savings: $1,400

3. **Net Impact**:
   - Additional Cost (DCO Instance): $360
   - Potential Savings (LedgerSpace Reduction): $1,400
   - Net Monthly Savings: $1,040

**Considerations**:
- The separate DCO instance would need to handle the intensive calculations without impacting regular operations.
- Data synchronization between the main LedgerSpace and the DCO instance would be required, which could add complexity and potential data transfer costs.
- The reduced LedgerSpace instance should still be capable of handling regular transaction loads and queries efficiently.

**Recommendation**:
Based on this analysis, moving the DCO to a separate instance could potentially reduce overall costs while improving system performance. However, it's crucial to thoroughly test this setup to ensure it meets performance requirements and doesn't introduce unacceptable complexity or data consistency issues.
