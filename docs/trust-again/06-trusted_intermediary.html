      <h2>Data sovereignty</h2>
      <p>
        Your data irrevocably belongs to you. Your shared data, such as
        credexes, belong to you and your counterparty. The ecosystem provides
        cryptographically secure storage and sharing of any type of data using
        publicly auditable code. The ecosystem enables sovereign humans to set
        their own granular preferences for data privacy and data sharing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Anonymity and privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Every human deserves to be anonymous sometimes. There is no reason to
        restrict public information based on someone's desire to remain
        anonymous in the fact that they have requested it.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, many digital interactions require different levels of
        verification and security. Allowing anonymous bank accounts, for
        example, would be a recipe for disaster because it would remove
        accountability. There are also many cases where simple verification that
        the data is being requested by a real human (like a captcha) is all that
        is required, but anonymity is still desirable and agreeable to both
        parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem enables granular, human-centric controls for
        anonymity, privacy, and security that can be modified to meet any need.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Trusted intermediary</h2>
      <p>
        The shared ledger is the core of the ecosystem, and is the reference
        point for transactions, wealth circulation and accumulation, and
        identity management. The credex ecosystem and the shared ledger
        cryptographically bind data to sovereign humans, with no backdoor
        access.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implementation and evolution of the ecosystem and the shared ledger
        requires the existence of a trusted intermediary, with trusted
        governance and decision making processes. This intermediary is required
        in order to set the foundational conditions that enable the ecosystem to
        exist, and to govern the specific rights and responsibilities of
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trusted intermediary is the Credex Foundation. The Foundation is
        democratically governed under the principle that every member has one
        equal voice in these decisions that affect us all. The ways that this
        principle could be implemented are varied and will evolve, but the focus
        of one sovereign human equals one sovereign vote will always guide
        Foundation governance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Credex Foundation</h2>
      <p>
        The Credex Foundation does not lead the ecosystem. The Credex Foundation
        is the foundation of the ecosystem. It is essential that the foundation
        be strong and stable, but unless something has gone wrong, we should
        barely notice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Credex Foundation is the reference point for the flow of natural
        resources entering the organic economy. The Foundation creates a market
        by bifurcating the natural resources from the right to consume them. The
        resources themselves are purchased by businesses who compete with each
        other for access to these resources. This competition sets their market
        value. In the same gesture, the Foundation distributes the right to
        consume these resources equally to all. This is done by distributing the
        value received from the competing businesses (and DCO gifts) equally to
        all DCO participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        This distribution of value is what provides every DCO participant with
        one equal share of the wealth entering the organic economy today. The
        value that is distributed to each participant is always 1.000 CXX.
        Participants use this credcoin value to purchase from businesses,
        completing the loop, and anchoring the value of one credcoin firmly in
        market-based reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Credex Foundation channels the heartbeat of the DCO through the
        primary circulatory system of the organic economy.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Digital assets and balance sheets</h2>
      <p>
        The digital asset protocols of the ecosystem are built on the strengths
        explored above:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The ability to issue, accept, and redeem credexes (contingent assets
          and liabilities).
        </li>
        <li>
          A multi-denominational accounting protocol that provides daily market
          inputs at global and local scales, keeping assets marked to their
          current value in any denomination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data sovereignty and cryptographically secured digital identity
          management for sovereign humans.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trusted and auditable democratic processes that protect and verify
          peer-to-peer auditable protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          A fully independent market reference point for the core asset of a
          human economy, which is the natural resource flows that sustain it.
        </li>
        <li>Regulatory compliance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These strengths enable highly reliable and secure records of asset
        ownership to be entered into the shared ledger in an economically
        accurate manner. These are not digital assets, they are digital records
        of asset ownership, linked as closely as is technically feasible with
        specific real or digital assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The record of digital ownership of an asset is intended to match and
        help cryptographically enforce the legal reality of ownership.
        Eventually, with enough publicly auditable and hardened code, and enough
        demonstrated reliability, these records on the shared ledger will become
        a trusted legal reference point in and of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on these records of digital assets, the ecosystem builds
        multi-denominational, customizable balance sheets from the ground up.
        The exchange of a credex can trigger the transfer of ownership of a
        specific digital asset-marker, smoothing transactions and enabling fully
        granular and privacy-conscious tracking of any asset through the chains
        of value creation all the way to consumption.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Core digital identity management</h2>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem utilizes cryptographic technologies to provide you
        with secure and exclusive access to your data, with protocols and
        granular permissions that enable you to share it seamlessly with other
        members and corporations, as well as protocols (such as credex itself)
        that enable counterparties to cooperatively create data, and own it
        together under customizable and freely agreed conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        With publicly auditable code, the ecosystem expects critical feedback,
        security analysis, and bug reporting, and filters this feedback to
        prioritize protecting human sovereignty. Sovereignty includes
        accountability for one's actions, and the right to be left alone in the
        absence of due democratic and judicial process. The Credex Foundation
        exists to protect the sovereignty of its members, and the development
        and deployment of cryptographic protocols to execute this governance
        mission within the ecosystem is of primary importance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Platform advantage</h2>
      <p>
        This purpose, as well as all the practical tools and powers of the
        ecosystem, give credex a massive advantage in the corporate race for
        platform-level dominance, simply because the credex ecosystem is not
        owned by a profit-focused limited liability corporation. Extracting
        profit through monopolistic dominance of a data ecosystem, and the
        access to user data that this enables, is simply not of collective
        benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so human sovereignty, expressed through democratic process, rules
        and centres the collective platform of the credex ecosystem. The
        expressed purpose of the platform, and its democratic governance, is to
        empower all with a sovereign foundation to grow and profit from, and
        then stay mostly out of our way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credex has a magnetic case for member adoption, with privacy and
        security assurances far beyond the usual corporate black box. Not only
        does the purpose of the ecosystem align with human needs for respect and
        privacy, the effectiveness of the codebase in achieving its purpose can
        be audited and publicly analyzed, criticized, and contributed to.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Corporate opportunity</h2>
      <p>
        The corporate race over platform-level dominance may not be of
        collective benefit, but giving corporations free reign to operate within
        the ground rules of a democratically-governed ecosystem, and take
        advantage of every potential it offers, is of great collective benefit.
        The ecosystem enables anyone, corporate or human, to create and host
        their own environment within the ecosystem, starting with a credex
        account and growing from there. The kind of granular user and
        transaction data that becomes available when there is a core digital
        identity in the background of every one of your customers, replete with
        personal data of every kind, is an extremely attractive proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Giving members cryptographically secured control of their own data means
        that corporations can't sell it. However, consumers are happy to give
        data of all kinds to corporations who earn their trust, to use for the
        purposes agreed between the corporation and the consumer. When a
        corporation earns a consumer's trust within the credex ecosystem, it can
        gain access to a treasure trove of secure, verifiable, and transparently
        shared data with the granting of simple permissions. When a corporation
        violates a consumer's trust, those customers and potential customers
        will simply take their business somewhere else, along with their data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The native member-empowering features bestowed by the ecosystem position
        credex to become the core digital identity management platform for
        members, and position other corporate entities to profit by adopting
        credex. The ecosystem achieves this simply by putting members ourselves,
        rather than corporations owned by others, in the core position of power
        and responsibility in our own digital lives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Independence from unstable systems</h2>
      <p>
        The credex ecosystem has the power to fundamentally transform the entire
        financial industry, changing the very fabric of the banking system and
        eliminating the need for outside sovereigns altogether in the financial
        realm. Once democracy-based processes set the framework, they can pretty
        much stay out of our way as we each create the future we want for
        ourselves in cooperative and systemically healthy exchange with each
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the first natural consequences of entering the ecosystem can be a
        growing sense of stable independence from toxic systems. Whether your
        concern is environmental sustainability, freedom, prosperity, human
        rights, growth of capital, diversity, economic justice, privacy,
        security, or all of the above, the credex ecosystem provides
        independence from systems that have proven unable to express these
        values in effective ways in the modern world.
      </p>
      <p>
        With credex we have a new option. Simply by directing the flows of our
        economic energy through the credex ecosystem, we energize systems that
        are fundamentally built on the values we care about most. As we enter
        the organic economy and build it through our exchanges, we open the
        horizons on vastly different futures for ourselves and our descendants
        on this earth and beyond.
