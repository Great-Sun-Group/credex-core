5. Logging Wrapper:
   Create src/utils/logger.ts with standardized logging functions.

6. HTTP Request Helper:
   Create src/utils/httpUtils.ts for handling axios requests like those in src/core-cron/DCO/fetchZigRate.ts and src/core-cron/DCO/DCOexecute.ts.

7. Config Loading:
   Create src/utils/configUtils.ts for centralized configuration loading.

8. Type Guards:
   Include type guard functions like `isNeo4jError` in src/utils/typeGuards.ts.

These changes will improve code reusability, reduce duplication, and make it easier to maintain and update common functionalities across the application.
