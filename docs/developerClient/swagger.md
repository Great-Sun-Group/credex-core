# Swagger

This guide focuses on using Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation for AI-assisted development of client applications interacting with the Credex Core API.

## Using Swagger for AI Context

The Credex Core API uses Swagger for comprehensive API documentation. This provides a machine-readable description of the API, which is ideal for AI-assisted development.

To use the Swagger documentation for AI context:

1. Access the Swagger UI at `https://mycredex.app/v1/api-docs`.
2. For programmatic access or to provide to AI models, use the raw Swagger JSON at `https://mycredex.app/v1/api-docs.json`.

## Benefits of Swagger for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Comprehensive API Description**: Swagger provides a complete overview of all API endpoints, methods, parameters, and response structures.

2. **Machine-Readable Format**: The JSON format is easily parseable by AI models and development tools.

3. **Interactive Documentation**: The Swagger UI allows for easy exploration and testing of API endpoints.

4. **Automatic Code Generation**: Many tools can generate client-side code based on Swagger specifications.

5. **Consistent Updates**: As the API evolves, the Swagger documentation automatically reflects these changes.

## Best Practices

1. Always refer to the latest Swagger documentation for the most up-to-date API information.
2. Use the Swagger JSON as input for AI models when seeking assistance with API integration or usage.
3. Leverage Swagger-based code generation tools for creating client-side API wrappers.

By focusing on Swagger, you ensure that AI-assisted development is based on the most accurate and current API specifications, leading to more efficient and error-free development of client applications.
