# Handle Neo4j Connection Variables in Deployment Process

## Changes Made

1. Updated `terraform/main.tf`:
   - Added a `null_resource` for post-deployment configuration to update SSM parameters with actual Neo4j instance details.
   - Modified SSM parameter resources to use default or placeholder values when actual values are not available during initial deployment.
   - Updated outputs to handle cases where values might not be available yet.

2. Updated GitHub Actions workflow files:
   - Added a post-deployment configuration step in `.github/workflows/deploy-development.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`, and `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`.
   - This step runs the `null_resource` to update SSM parameters after Neo4j instances are created.

3. Updated `docs/deploy/neo4j_deployment.md`:
   - Added information about the new post-deployment configuration step.
   - Included a note about testing changes in a safe environment before applying to production.
   - Updated the troubleshooting section to include guidance on handling incorrect Neo4j connection information.

## Reason for Changes

These changes address the issue of handling variables that are not available until after installation, while also considering existing resources and potential updates. The solution provides a way to update the necessary information post-deployment, ensuring that the correct Neo4j connection details are available for the application to use.

## Testing Instructions

1. Deploy to the development environment using the updated workflow.
2. Verify that the SSM parameters are correctly updated with the Neo4j instance details after deployment.
3. Check that the application can successfully connect to the Neo4j instances using the updated connection information.
4. Run the existing Neo4j validation tests to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Notes

- These changes should be thoroughly tested in the development environment before being applied to staging or production.
- Monitor the first few deployments closely to ensure the post-deployment configuration step is working correctly.
- Update any relevant team documentation or runbooks to reflect these changes in the deployment process.
