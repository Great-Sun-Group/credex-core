    <h2>
      1. Organizing and incentivising the distributed production of economic
      value
    </h2>
    <p>
        The credex ecosystem enables low friction value creating exchange of
        real goods and services.
    </p>

    <h2>
      2. Building economic resilience because modern money is systemically
      vulnerable to existing and looming changes in its environment
    </h2>
    <p>
        The credex ecosystem enables transactions independent of modern money
        and money systems, yet integrated seamlessly with them.
      </p>

    <h2>      3. Financially aligning an economic network to produce maximum value
      within evolving limits of sustainability
    </h2>
    <p>
        The credex ecosystem and the daily credcoin offering will bring market
        dynamics and the full power of capital to bear on the challenge of
        aligning an economic network within the limits of sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Building widespread multigenerational wealth</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The credex ecosystem enables widespread accumulation of real and
        financial capital across a network of economic nodes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The credex ecosystem enables low friction transactions and value
        creating loops of exchange to build this capital.
      </li>
      <li>
        The credex ecosystem is a financial network that can stably operate
        within the limits of ecological sustainability, and therefore endure for
        the long term.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Empowering human sovereignty</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The credex ecosystem empowers all of its members with the daily right to
        consume natural resources at sustainable levels, and provides a
        voluntary and business friendly mechanism to implement this in a way
        that moves our economic network towards wealth generating alignment with
        the biosphere.
      </li>
      <li>
        The credex ecosystem empowers all members to create their own medium of
        exchange, and control its value by the provision (or lack thereof) of
        real value as contracted.
      </li>
      <li>
        The credex ecosystem offers all of its members the power to own their
        own data and share it on their own terms only. (This right is currently
        enforced only programmatically, with cryptographic enforcement to be
        implemented with the future development of web3 infrastructure.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example DCO Scenarios</h2>

    <h3>FIG.2 illustrates an example DCO Day 1 - Day 2</h3>
    <p>
      Alice, a single DCO participant on launch day, gives 1.000 CXX worth of
      CAD to the Credex Foundation via a DCO intermediary, and receiving a
      credex worth 1.000 CXX, which is backed by $1.00 CAD held in the DCO
      secured account of the DCO intermediary.
    </p>

    <h3>FIG. 3 illustrates an example DCO Day 2 - Day 3</h3>
    <p>
      Alice increases her gift to 1.010 CXX worth of CAD ($1.01) and receives
      1.000 CXX, which is worth $1.01.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Not shown below are the CXX balances on prior day's credexes. These
      balances also adjust in the DCO according to the same CXX rates that the
      credexes below use. See FIG. 9)
    </p>

    <h3>FIG. 4 illustrates an example DCO Day 3 - Day 4</h3>
    <p>
      Bob joins at a higher DCO gift rate, significantly increasing the value of
      CXX on Day 4.
    </p>

    <h3>FIG. 5 illustrates an example DCO Day 4 - Day 5</h3>
    <p>
      A third participant, a second DCO intermediary, and a second denomination
      are added.
    </p>

    <h3>FIG. 6 illustrates an example DCO Day 5 - Day 6</h3>
    <p>
      Charlie participates only in the market based DCO. The CXX value she
      issues to the Credex Foundation is included in all of the DCO
      calculations, and goes into the pool of value that backs the DCO-R
      transactions.
    </p>

    <h3>FIG. 7 illustrates an example DCO Day 6 - Day 7</h3>
    <p>
      The DCO is self-sustaining, even without currency (or some other asset)
      involved, however the ecosystem would lose the ability to reliably
      denominate credexes in anything other than CXX.
    </p>

    <h3>FIG. 8 illustrates an example DCO Security Account</h3>
    <p>
      Funds will be released from the DCO security account when the DCO
      intermediary (the holder of the account) receives a specific type of
      credex, coded (via smart contract or DCO intermediary activity) to
      transfer money to the counterparty only when the credex is credlooped
      through the Credex Foundation. The intermediary's debt to the Credex
      Foundation is retired as currency is released.
    </p>

    <p>
      A premium will be charged when seeking to buy currency with credex. That
      premium will be set at 2% on launch, and will be market driven once there
      are other DCO intermediaries to create a market between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the value of the natural wealth entering the organic economy changes
      significantly from one day to the next, as in this scenario, credex
      denominated in CXX will numerically fluctuate in lockstep with changes in
      that flow, while the value will remain rock steady.
    </p>

    <h3>Week 1, according to Alice</h3>

    <p>
      On Day01 Alice gives 1.000 CXX, indicating one equal share of natural
      resources consumption for her that day. On Day01, 1.000 CXX is equivalent
      to $1.00 CAD. She gives $1.00 (not shown above) and receives a credex
      worth $1.00 CAD (DCO-R01) as Day02 begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      From Day02 through Day05, Alice has her DCO gift amount set at 1.010,
      indicating consumption of 1% more than one equal share of natural
      resources. On Day02, 1.010 CXX is equivalent to $1.01 CAD. She gives $1.01
      and receives a credex worth $1.01 CAD (DCO-R02) as Day03 begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Day03, 1.010 CXX is equivalent to $1.02 CAD. She gives $1.02 and
      receives a credex worth $1.22 CAD (DCO-R03) as Day04 begins. This is
      because Bob joined, giving 1.400 CXX, indicating greater relative resource
      consumption, whose value is shared among all DCO participants (including
      Bob himself).
    </p>

    <p>
      On Day04, 1.010 CXX is equivalent to $1.23 CAD. She gives $1.23 and
      receives a credex worth $1.23 CAD (DCO-R05) as Day05 begins. Charlie has
      joined at 0.550 CXX, and the change in flow of one equal share is so minor
      today that it becomes a rounding error in CAD. The wealth that previously
      flowed from Bob to Alice now flows to Charlie due to his lower consumption
      of natural resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Day05, 1.010 CXX is equivalent to $1.24 CAD. She gives $1.24 and
      receives a credex worth $1.27 CAD (DCO-R08) as Day06 begins.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Day06 when she views her DCO receive transactions in CAD, she sees the
      total amount of $5.72 CAD. When she views her account in CXX, she sees a
      total of 4.519 times the value of the natural wealth entering the organic
      economy on Day06.
