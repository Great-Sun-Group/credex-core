      <h2>Building on the foundation</h2>
      <p>
        Orienting on the heartbeat of the DCO, credcoin forms the foundation of
        the organic economy. The concept, and calculated implementation, of one
        equal share of the value harvested from nature today anchors all values
        in the ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organic economics orients around the flow of economic value creation,
        growth and consumption. Organic economics understands this flow to be
        analogous to, and also intimately bound to, the flow of energy
        absorption and dissolution across the biosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The credcoin equation is based on the values that flow across these
        chains, and provides the 1.000 CXX reference point that orients us to a
        very specific variable that we consciously declare will become our
        constant, as these real and measurable values fluctuate. The stabilized
        variable of credcoin always orients us relative to the total economic
        value of the energy that crosses from the natural world into the organic
        economy today relative to the number of humans who need to be provided
        for from this energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        As values flow up our economic chains from the core right to harvest
        natural resources through various layers of processing and distribution
        towards consumption, there is a general shape to these organic
        processes.
      </p>

      <h2>The gift is primal</h2>
      <p>
        For the vast majority of the time that humans have had economies powered
        by division of labour, the primary medium of exchange has been infinite
        variations of the reciprocal gift. The gift in various forms pervades
        family structures, tribal culture, and many religious expressions. The
        gift remains central but mostly unnoticed in modern economies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The sun of mutual value</h2>
      <p>
        Although the gift can be more effective at personal scales, it is the
        qualities of barter that provide the principles for a scalable medium of
        exchange. The critical and scalable quality of barter is that value is
        dependably created on both sides of every transaction. This may or may
        not be true of reciprocal gifts, but it is always true of a barter
        transaction at the moment it is agreed to.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, each of the counterparties parts with something that
        they value less than what they obtain through the transaction. The very
        motivation of barter is that one receives something that one values more
        than what one parts with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Value is created on both sides of a barter transaction. This principle
        is the fusion at the heart of the star that powers modern economies of
        every kind. The sun of the organic economy, like every other
        exchange-based economy, is this barter-based principle of mutual value
        creation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Value exchange through credex</h2>
      <p>
        An outstanding credex represents an imbalance in the value delivered
        vis-a-vis the value received. An outstanding credex is a placeholder for
        value. In barter, each party immediately receives what they value. A
        credex, like money, enables counterparties to exchange value across
        complex chains, where those we purchase from usually are not those we
        sell to, yet everyone receives exactly what they desire (as expressed
        through purchases), and provides exactly what they are able to provide
        (as expressed through sales or income).
      </p>
      <p>
        Markets are competitive structures, but succeeding in a market requires
        leveraging cooperative effort across vast numbers of humans. Mutual
        value creation, like the gift, is fundamentally cooperative in nature.
        The corporate associations that enable and scale this mutual value
        creation are based on mutual cooperation, mutual risk, and mutual
        profit. In a well structured market, those who can leverage the values
        created by others with the greatest efficiency, while providing more
        value back to counterparties in every transaction than the counterparty
        parts with, are those who achieve economic success. This is the kind of
        success and wealth that we can all celebrate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The growth impulse of profit</h2>
      <p>
        As the energy of the sun enters the biosphere, it is absorbed by life,
        and life transforms this energy into growth. In organic economics, the
        accumulation of profit is an outward sign of this growth, just as the
        accumulation of biomass or energy is an outward sign of the growth
        impulse provided by the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        In organic economics, the diversity of the holders of profit is
        analogous to the diversity of the biosphere. The greater the diversity,
        the greater the strength, resilience, and ability to innovate to take
        advantage of new opportunities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The accumulation of systemic wealth</h2>
      <p>
        A system with diverse layers of living biomass naturally creates
        excesses. In biology these excesses can be seen (for example) as stores
        of fat energy, rested muscles, and the comfortable capacity to feed
        oneself into the indefinite future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The connection between biological and economic wealth can be clearly
        seen. Where biological wealth (biomass accumulation and diversity) is
        scarce, it is generally harder to extract economic value. Where
        biological wealth is abundant, economic wealth is generally easier to
        obtain. When the ocean is full of fish, it's easy to make a buck in
        fisheries. When the oceans are empty, it's often best to invest your
        dollar elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        These accumulations of economic wealth are capital, and understanding
        capital as a social force is critical to understanding organic
        economics. Capital has specific properties, qualities, and desires that
        need to be understood independently of the owners of capital. Above all,
        capital wants to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life is the sun impulse manifest. Capital is the growth impulse
        manifest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Symbiotic investment</h2>
      <p>
        In the organic economy, investment of accumulated capital is analogous
        to biological symbiosis, in which resources and advantages are
        transferred between counterparties in mutually beneficial ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the organic economy, profit accumulates as capital when a human or
        corporation creates more wealth and advantage for others than is
        consumed in the process of creating that wealth. This new capital has
        eager growth energy, and will often be reinvested in the business in
        which it was generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        As that continually reinvested capital brings ever greater returns in
        successful businesses, it matures through the economic cycle. As the
        accumulation grows, so does the pressure to diversify it into other
        ventures in the form of growth and return-generating investments. When
        capital that has grown in one location of the economy moves via
        investment to another location, the expectation is that it will generate
        additional value in that new location, then also return greater value to
        the location from which it was invested. In this way the growth energy
        of capital flows and multiplies across the economy, contributing both to
        the distribution (in the entrepreneur) and centralization (in the
        investor) of wealth.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The gift is the ultimate expression</h2>
      <p>
        As the growth force of capital matures, it stabilizes and gradually
        ossifies, like an ancient tree in the forest after centuries of life, or
        like a fruit fly in the orchard after days of life. The dynamism and
        energy of the growth force naturally loses its momentum through time and
        recirculation. Sometimes the plant absorbs the sun ray, is consumed, and
        its power subsequently circulates through and energizes many systems of
        life across species and geographies. And sometimes the plant dies hours
        after absorbing that sun ray, and immediately decomposes into the soil.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eventual destiny of all biological life is death, which closes the
        circle and disperses nutrients and residual energy for the next cycle of
        life to feed on. And throughout its entire life, every living thing
        produces biological material that is waste to the individual biological
        being, but undergoes the same process of decay as the being itself will
        in death. Life itself creates and necessitates death and decay. All
        material that is absorbed by life will eventually be returned to the
        environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eventual destiny of all economic value is consumption. When value
        becomes capital, it becomes something that can be invested or gifted
        first, but the eventual destiny of all economic capital is gift and
        consumption. This organic dynamic closes the circle and disperses value
        and residual energy for the next cycle of economic value to grow from.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Markets and gifts</h2>
      <p>
        Markets tend towards equilibrium, but gifts open potentials for the
        extraordinary. In barter exchanges, and the markets that arise from
        complex barter interactions, the dynamic is to offer as little value to
        another in exchange for the most possible value to oneself. This
        self-interested dynamic tends towards equilibrium and the equalization
        of value exchange. The dynamic of desiring and valuing certain goods and
        services for oneself over others is what gives rise to the possibility
        of barter, mutual value exchange, markets, profit, capital, and modern
        economic growth in the first place. And yet the generous gift can be
        even more potent than the self-interested market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gift has always been the primal form of value exchange, and gifts
        continue to anchor and nurture modern economies in ways that often go
        unrecognized. The gift is the decomposition of economic value. The gift
        leads to the final consumption of value, with no expected direct
        economic outcome. And yet, the gift is the vehicle for economic rebirth.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The power of gifts</h2>
      <p>
        The gift of a scholarship opens the path for the next innovative genius
        to develop the next innovative solution to save millions of lives. The
        gift of a meal saves someone who goes on to become a search and rescue
        hero for countless others. The gift of life, nourishment, and a secure
        and supported childhood gives the next generation potentials that we can
        only dream of. The gift of education enables a budding entrepreneur to
        raise their eyes to global horizons and solve a problem being
        experienced by millions, amass a fortune, and donate billions to worthy
        charities. The gift of a pair of sneakers begins a basketball career
        that inspires millions and generates wealth for many.
      </p>
      <p>
        What unites these examples is that a gift is given without expectation
        of return, and yet contains a tremendous potential to generate massively
        positive impacts, including direct economic impacts, for others across
        the system. It does this by engaging capacities in places and in ways
        that transaction-based wealth cannot reach and sustain, for whatever
        reason.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The gift impulse</h2>
      <p>
        Whereas purchase transactions are about the creation of value on both
        sides, and investment transactions are about the growth of capital, gift
        transactions are about the release of value without expectation of
        return. And like the rich soil that enables a rich ecosystem, rich gifts
        enable rich economies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impulse to give is as deeply human as the impulse to consume. The
        impulse to give can arise with the first accumulations of value. Organic
        economics recognizes the gift impulse as a social force with its own
        properties, qualities, and desires that need to be understood
        independently of specific gifts and givers. Above all, gifts strive to
        provide value where efficient but self-interested market forces do not
        meet specific human needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parenting and raising children is a gift. Education is a gift. Culture
        is a gift. Charity to those in need is a gift. Cleaning trash off a
        beach is a gift. Supporting a cause is a gift. To give is deeply human,
        and the gift impulse is a critical component of organic economics. The
        organic economy celebrates gifts as an expression of the highest
        economic good, matched only by the creation of the value and capital
        that enables them.
