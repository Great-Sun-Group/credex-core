    <p>Each of the above listed items are elaborated on below:</p>

    <h3>
      1. Organizing and incentivising the distributed production of economic
      value
    </h3>

    <p>
      With division of labour, value produced by one participant (node) in an
      economic network is consumed by another node. In order to maximize the
      value creation processes in the network, nodes must produce for other
      nodes, and the values (goods and services) produced must flow to where
      those specific values are most needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problems for a network of economic participants are to incentivise the
      efficiently distributed production of value across the network, organize
      this distributed production so that maximum value is created across the
      network, incentivize the circulation of value within the network so that
      it flows to where it is most needed, and organize these processes with the
      greatest possible ease (lowest possible level of friction) for economic
      participants. Solutions to this problem enable us to generate wealth
      together.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2. Building economic resilience because modern money is systemically
      vulnerable to existing and looming changes in its environment
    </h3>

    <p>
      Modern money is a highly evolved and mature system, which has outcompeted
      all alternatives through fair means and foul to become and remain the most
      effective way for humans to generate wealth and grow capital together in
      global scale economic networks. Modern money is a global solution to the
      problem of organizing and incentivising the distributed production of
      economic value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money requires fungibility to function. Every unit of currency is required
      to be equivalent to and interchangeable with every other unit of that
      denomination. This requirement fundamentally abstracts the financial
      operations of a money economy from the real and specific values being
      exchanged. Without this abstraction, money would be useless. It wouldn't
      be money.
    </p>

    <p>
      Traditional double entry accounting sees pools (balance sheets) and flows
      (income statements), but not the way that these connect into networks.
      This makes the money system opaque to observation, except at a surface
      level. Real economic value is created in a distributed manner and
      circulates along specific paths between economic participants, but money
      cannot do so in a transparent manner. And so the real values being
      exchanged underneath the surface of money, and more importantly the real
      people and corporations exchanging them, are obscured into an ocean of
      abstract and fully interchangeable currency values. Value is created and
      exchanged in networks, but money only sees disconnected pools and flows.
    </p>

    <p>
      This foundational level abstraction creates an impenetrable fog around
      money. We cannot know where the dollar in our bank account was created,
      where it travelled to get to us, or what asset or credit issuer backs it.
      Although we talk about money
      "circulating," money is actually fungible to the point where a currency
      unit cannot and does not have a discrete existence that can be tracked
      along a path of exchange. Money is more like the ocean. Add water
      anywhere, and the whole system quickly adjusts with a raised water level
      across the globe (inflation). Remove water and the water level everywhere
      will drop (deflation).
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern money is primarily created when economic participants use leverage
      to multiply their accumulations of capital. In this process, a pool of
      existing money (or money-like assets that are denominated in currency) is
      leveraged from the balance sheet of a node in order to create more money.
      The created money then joins the network of commerce and the flows of
      income and expenses, coalescing into pools of capital on the balance
      sheets of other nodesâ€¦ which are then leveraged into more money. In this
      context it is meaningless even to look for the original value being
      leveraged. There is nothing other than leverage. Modern money is a
      self-referential math-based flow of balance sheet leverage.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em
          >"The problem is that we cannot extract from our statistical database
          what is true money conceptually, either in the transactions mode or
          the store-of-value mode. One of the reasons, obviously, is that the
          proliferation of products has been so extraordinary that the true
          underlying mix of money in our money and near money data is
          continuously changing. As a consequence, while of necessity it must be
          the case at the end of the day that inflation has to be a monetary
          phenomenon, a decision to base policy on measures of money

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In a centuries long process, money has lost its anchor to anything other
      than itself. Our units of account are so far abstracted as to be
      completely meaningless in relationship to the real physical and economic
      underpinnings of wealth. Any value measured in currency means nothing
      outside of a specific set of relationships at a specific moment in time.
      $1.00 today means something very different from $1.00 a century ago. In
      times of high inflation or deflation, the meaning of $1.00 can change very
      quickly. As potent and powerful as the numbers are, in a way they are also
      deeply meaningless. We collectively make them up with no regards to
      anything other than themselves, and yet they influence and even control us
      and our real physical world in obvious and powerful ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that, as a highly evolved system existing as nothing but
      abstraction, fine tuned to thrive under a specific set of conditions,
      modern money is systemically vulnerable to changes in these conditions.
      From the 1950s through to August 9, 2007, when economic or financial trauma impacted
      nodes in the money network, the network itself remained relatively stable,
      the nodes adapted or others replaced them, and the network as a whole
      continued to thrive and grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there are changes in the conditions under which the money economy
      exists that have come to threaten the integrity of the network as a whole.
      A process has begun in which vulnerabilities and instabilities due to
      these changed conditions are constantly building up in system-critical
      nodes such as "too big to fail" (TBTF) financial institutions and
      sovereign governments. These pressures release periodically in risk
      repricing events that cascade from these nodes across the money network.
      In these events, suddenly the anchorless, leveraged, opaque abstraction
      that is money is forcefully brought back into line with an underlying
      economic reality. Depending on how much pressure has built on the
      liquidity of these system-critical nodes, these risk repricing shocks can
      have impact far beyond the balance sheets of the affected parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      When perceived risk changes materially, the market prices of financial
      assets held on balance sheets are repriced, which changes the leverage
      math of money creation. When the money-math for multiple system-critical
      balance sheets demands that these nodes deleverage, this process has the
      potential to systemically degrade the money network itself (eg 2007-2008).
      Then, with a degraded solution to the problem of organizing and
      incentivizing the production of economic value, fewer wealth building
      opportunities exist and the real economy suffers (eg 2008-2010 and
      onward).
    </p>

    <p>
      The severity and regularity of these risk repricing events in money
      economies may prove to determine the fate of money. There is a potential
      threshold of capital flight from modern money economies due to these
      events, and past that threshold the flow of leverage could dry up at an
      accelerating pace. The self-referential power of leverage that gave modern
      money its explosive growth energy could turn on itself in its decline,
      with capital fleeing because of the results of capital fleeing in a rapid
      death spiral.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inflation and deflation are necessary evils of money economies. At a
      surface level they could be seen as the problem, but they are merely
      symptoms of the money-math dynamics. Inflation and deflation are also the
      transmission mechanism for systemic monetary dislocations. Risk repricing
      events are transmitted from the balance sheets of system-critical nodes by
      these dynamics to every single economic participant in the modern money
      network, which is all of us.
    </p>

    <p>
      The deeper underlying problem is the vulnerable and impoverished position
      we would all be in should the modern money network ever fail, or even
      falter again.
    </p>

    <h3>
      3. Financially aligning an economic network to produce maximum value
      within evolving limits of sustainability
    </h3>

    <p>
      The fundamental, systemic, historical change we are living through in the
      environment in which money operates is the change from an economically
      empty world to an economically full world. We believe that this dynamic,
      which has been building for centuries, underlies a series of major risk
      repricing events experienced in global markets since August 9, 2007.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jeff Snider at <a href="https://www.eurodollar.university/">
      Eurodollar University</a> calls these eurodollar events, and has identified an ongoing
      numbered series of them that are clearly visible across significant swaths
      of market data. His analysis is focused on the market data and internal
      money-math system dynamics. Here we posit that the transition from an
      empty world to a full world is the driving cause of this instability.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are limits to the resources that an economy can harvest from the
      natural world and the wastes it can release, without putting future yields
      at risk. In many cases across the world, what once were risks to future
      yields have become actual declines in the present. The costs of fossil
      fuel depletion and environmental damage continue to ratchet slowly and unevenly
      upwards, and over-harvesting of all kinds depletes local ecosystems
      everywhere. Atlantic cod, easy Texas oilfields, desertified Amazonâ€¦ these
      are just a few of the rich resources that are gone and for the most part
      are not coming back in our lifetimes. This unsustainable overconsumption
      of natural capital and the blowback from pollution of various kinds has
      real economic costs that must eventually be paid, and the longer our
      economies operate outside the limits of sustainability, the greater the
      costs become. An economic network capable of generating long term wealth
      must operate fully within the limits of sustainability. Money economies
      have historically proven to operate beyond those limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is that money economies have no way to intrinsically ensure
      that consumption occurs within the limits of sustainability. In the
      paradigm of money economies, the only way to ensure sustainability is to
      force capital and business to comply with specific and detailed
      environmental regulations. But there will be no winners in this war of
      legislation versus capital, and we are all losing because of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is twofold: how to determine the limits to sustainability, and
      how to align an economic network and its processes of capital creation in
      healthy and wealth generating ways within those limits instead of fighting
      against them. We take the fact that these limits exist as a given, but
      here we take no position on what those limits are or should be. Here we
      are focused on the problem of financially aligning an economy to produce
      maximum value and enable maximum capital growth within the limits of
      sustainability, whatever those limits may be now or may become in the
      future.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Building widespread multigenerational wealth</h3>

    <p>
      Widespread multigenerational wealth requires widespread accumulation of
      real and financial capital across a network of economic nodes. Widespread
      multigenerational wealth requires low friction transactions and systems of
      exchange to build this capital. Widespread multigenerational wealth
      requires a financial network that can stably operate within the limits of
      ecological sustainability, and therefore endure for the long term.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Empowering human sovereignty</h3>

    <p>
      The problem is that modern money requires humans to surrender certain
      aspects of our sovereignty, and the power that we have surrendered is now
      being used to abuse our earth, our fellow human beings, and ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      Core sovereign powers that our solution natively supports for all network
      members include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The power to sustainably consume natural resources.</li>
      <li>The power to create and control mediums of exchange.</li>
      <li>The power to securely own and share data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The problem is that money supports none of those things.</p>

    <h2>What have others done to solve these problems?</h2>

    <h3>
      1. Organizing and incentivising the distributed production of economic
      value
    </h3>

    <p>
      Mediums of exchange solve the problem of organizing and incentivising the
      distributed production of economic value. There are two core principles
      that underpin and exist within all free mediums of exchange: gift and
      purchase.
    </p>

    <h4>Gift:</h4>

    <p>
      The pure gift is the primal medium of exchange. Many cultures and economic
      networks solve the problem of organizing and incentivising the distributed
      production of economic value through the giving of gifts and the direct
      sharing of wealth. Gift economies are as old as humanity itself, and are
      very much alive today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Economically speaking, a gift occurs when value moves from one economic
      participant to another with no expectation of an equivalent value being
      provided directly back to the giver by the receiver. In most gift based
      economic networks all nodes give and all nodes receive, but not
      necessarily at equivalent levels, and not necessarily directly. These
      networks can be organized in incredibly diverse ways. Gifts may be
      incentivized by family ties, by pure altruism and love, by desire to be
      part of reciprocal giving, by customs and social obligations, or by any
      combination of these. The gift is the primal human solution to the problem
      of organizing and incentivising the distributed production of economic
      value.
    </p>

    <h4>Purchase:</h4>

    <p>
      The primal example of a purchase is a barter transaction where two nodes
      directly exchange values at the same moment and in such a way that both
      parties benefit. In a barter purchase, the needs and capacities of two
      nodes align, and both economic participants receive something that they
      value more than what they give in exchange. Economic value is created on
      both sides of a completed barter purchase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Purchases are able to create value because value is always relative, and
      an identical good or service can have a greater value to one node
      (purchaser) than it does to another node (seller) in the network. After
      the barter purchase, each party has something which they value more, so
      therefore total value within the network has been increased and each party
      to the transaction gains some part of that value.
    </p>

    <h4>Money:</h4>

    <p>
      Money is a medium of exchange that solves the problem of organizing and
      incentivizing the distributed production of value by extending the value
      creating principles of purchases across time and space, and to include
      multiple participants.
    </p>

    <p>
      In barter, powerful friction arises to value creating exchange because a
      node can only exchange with other nodes if and when they each have
      something that the other values. This is the problem of the "double
      coincidence of needs." The reason that gift rather than purchase is the
      primal human solution to the problem of enabling the circulation of value
      is because purchases in their primal form of barter really just don't work
      very well as a medium of exchange. The problem of the double coincidence
      of needs inserts too much friction for barter to scale beyond its specific
      and limited moments of utility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money solves barter's double coincidence of needs problem, while
      preserving the principle that every participant in a complete exchange
      receives something that they value more than what they exchange for it.
      Money multiplies the strengths of barter and minimizes its weaknesses,
      vastly decreasing the friction of value creating exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money extends the value creating power of purchase by acting as a
      placeholder between the time that an economic participant provides real
      value and the time they receive real value. When a node accepts
      placeholder money for the real value they provide, the full transaction is
      not yet complete. It is completed when the seller uses the money received
      to purchase the values that they themselves require. These currency
      placeholders, each of which is accepted across a subset of the global
      economy are powerful mediums of exchange, and together they make up the
      complex global system of modern money.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money solves the problem of organizing and incentivising the distributed
      production of economic value by providing a standard measurement of value,
      and providing a physical or ledger based assurance that real value will be
      received in the future. Money drastically reduces the friction of free
      value creating exchanges, exponentially multiplying the opportunities for
      economic participants to create value for themselves and for other nodes.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2. Building economic resilience because modern money is systemically
      vulnerable to existing and looming changes in its environment
    </h3>

    <p>Many solutions to this problem exist or have been proposed:</p>

    <h4>
      Sovereign governments, central banks, wholesale banks, shadow banks,
      retail banks:
    </h4>
    <p>
      The modern money system has incredible resilience. Its central nodes
      remain relatively strong, with no feasible and scalable alternative
      implemented anywhere that appears remotely capable of supporting the
      global economy in anything like its current form. The leadership of the
      elites and the continued evolution of modern money may prove to be the
      most successful response to its changed environment. Money itself has
      already survived for millenia, and modern money and its direct precursors
      for centuries.
    </p>

    <h4>Pure gift networks:</h4>
    <p>
      Community and family based, charity inspired economic networks already
      exist and could grow as a solution.
    </p>

    <h4>Hard money networks:</h4>
    <p>
      Gold (or any other physical asset that has value independent of its
      monetary value) could be monetized to enable value producing economic
      networks as has been done regularly in the past.
    </p>

    <h4>Fractional reserve money networks:</h4>
    <p>
      The precursor to widespread balance sheet capacity money was a limited
      version in which sovereign and central bank balance sheets controlled the
      money creation process via fractional reserve processes and regulations.
      These still exist today, and should modern money suffer some kind of
      catastrophic failure, fractional reserve is the likely fallback solution
      for governments.
    </p>

    <h4>Alternative currency networks:</h4>
    <p>
      Surviving at the margins, dramatically outcompeted by modern money as a
      global solution, these alternative currencies nevertheless offer multiple
      models to solve the problem of organizing and incentivising the
      distributed production of economic value, mostly operating at local or
      regional scales.
    </p>

    <h4>Mutual credit money networks:</h4>
    <p>
      A specific type of alternative currency, mutual credit systems are
      centralized accounting systems (ledger money) in which every transaction
      is a credit to one member's account and a debit to another, as described
      further here. These systems deserve special mention as a precursor to our
      solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem with these systems is that their stability requires a level of
      centralized credit control that chokes value producing economic activity
      with a huge amount of friction, to say nothing of the concerns about
      centralization of power that would arise should these systems scale. This
      requirement of centralized credit authorizations is tied up in the same
      dynamics of abstraction and leverage that plague all money economies with
      their resulting inflation and deflation.
    </p>

    <h4>Cryptocurrency networks:</h4>
    <p>
      The very thing that makes crypto appealing as an investment class
      (potential significant asset appreciation) makes it horrible as a medium
      of exchange, unit of account, or secure store of value. These all require
      stability. Therefore cryptocurrency networks aren't currently being used
      primarily as alternative solutions to the problem of building economic
      resilience because modern money is systemically vulnerable to existing and
      looming changes in its environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem with cryptocurrencies is that they have no underlying
      stability or inherent value. At the end of the day, however it was
      created, modern money has the apparent force of a tax collecting sovereign
      behind it. Crypto has no way to compete with that, so instead it is
      becoming part of the modern money system. The growing utilization of
      crypto within the balance sheet mechanics of modern money just layers one
      abstraction over another and enhances the self-referential dynamics of
      both, on the way up and on the way down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cryptocurrency deserves special mention because many of the technological
      underpinnings that will be used to implement our solution at scale will
      have precursors in cryptocurrency and web3 technical solutions and tools.
    </p>

    <h4>Demurrage:</h4>
    <p>
      Demurrage is the opposite of interest, first proposed by Silvio Gesell and
      expanded on by Rudoph Steiner.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a demurrage money system, once money is created it gradually decreases
      in value towards worthlessness. This approach was used in the German city
      of Worgl during the Great Depression to defy all expectations and
      transform their local economy. It is believed that demurrage reversed the
      hoarding impulse in a deflationary environment, encouraging the spending
      of money before it lost value. This spending multiplied value creation
      opportunities and kickstarted economic activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rudolph Steiner pointed out that all economic goods and services
      eventually get consumed, but money lives on forever. He identified this
      reality as a problematic disconnect between money and the real economy,
      and suggested demurrage as a solution to bring financial principles into
      alignment with economic reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Demurrage is not a consciously designed dynamic within our modern money
      economies, nor is it active in any other scalable solutions that we are
      aware of. It is noted here as a potential or hidden feature of money
      economies, one whose strengths have been noted by others and which we have
      incorporated into our moneyless solution.

      This overarching problem has been explored since humans began to care
      about the future material wellbeing of their children beyond the instinct
      to care for young in the present.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Empowering human sovereignty</h3>

    <p>
      Political evolution and experimentation towards greater freedom, mutual
      respect, and sovereignty has arisen in many times and places across
      history, and this impulse exists strongly in our time alongside many
      others. Multitudes of humans have offered solutions to this problem, and
      moved those solutions forward to get us to where we are today.
    </p>

    <h2>Where did they fall short in their solutions?</h2>

    <p>
      Our solution is an alternative to modern money. Our solution outcompetes
      money in principle and in initial testing across the five problem domains
      identified.
    </p>

    <h3>
      1. Organizing and incentivising the distributed production of economic
      value
    </h3>

    <p>
      In addition to the systemic vulnerabilities outlined elsewhere, and
      despite its incredible strengths as a medium of exchange, as a low
      friction solution to the problem of exchanging value across an economic
      network, money has significant shortcomings.
    </p>

    <h4>Payment processing:</h4>
    <p>
      Coins, cash, point of sale systems, credit cards, debit cards, tap
      payments, etransfers, EFTs, cheques, wires, returns, reversals, gift
      cards, identity verification, ATMs, bank tellers, merchant services, bank
      accounts, terminals, gateways, providers, authorizations, credit checks,
      default risks, know-your-customer, SWIFT, counterfeit, cryptocurrencies,
      digital walletsâ€¦
    </p>

    <p>Payment processing in the money economy is complex and high friction.</p>

    <h4>Foreign exchange rates:</h4>
    <p>
      The use of various currency denominations across the global money network
      creates friction between nodes at the user level, and it also creates
      fault lines and financial risk factors as different parts of the economy
      perform in different ways. Every time a currency barrier is crossed,
      systemic and abstracted risks are inserted into specific transactions and
      contracts, increasing friction between nodes and therefore limiting
      opportunities for value creating exchange.
    </p>

    <h4>Limited supply:</h4>
    <p>
      Money only has value if the money supply is limited. Removing limits on
      the supply of money leads to hyperinflation and the destruction of the
      currency. Since money supply must be limited, and economic participants
      are only able to participate in exchanges to the degree that they and
      their counterparties have access to money (or credit), this limit
      necessarily reduces market sizes, creating a continuous background level
      of friction for money as a medium of exchange. This friction is
      experienced most strongly at the margins of the economy, anywhere that
      wealth and access to capital are scarce.
    </p>

    <h4>Created for profit:</h4>
    <p>
      In the modern bank-managed money system, when nodes leverage their balance
      sheets, money is created by banks and shadow banks, incentivized by
      profit. Money creation is primarily the responsibility of third party
      private organizations whose purpose is shareholder profit. This bias
      (which is embedded because of where the money creation process takes
      place) systemically tilts decision making and flows of wealth towards the
      owners and operators of the money system: banks, financial institutions,
      and the pools of capital they serve. This is demonstrated clearly in
      crisis. Bailouts go to the banks, usually the biggest ones (TBTF), while
      the rest of the economy gets austerity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Money is a wealth generator and a profit enabler for all of us and all of
      our businesses. But when money itself is created for the profit of those
      who own the money system and create the money, it attracts capital
      excessively to the central hubs of the system, which reduces access to
      capital and therefore increases friction within the wealth creation
      process in the rest of the economy.
    </p>

    <h4>Extractive:</h4>
    <p>
      The money system rules of limited supply and profit motive outlined above
      establish a pattern that slowly but unceasingly extracts wealth from the
      periphery of the global economic network towards the core. The more
      central and wealthy that an economic node is today, the more likely it is
      that it will be even more central and wealthy tomorrow. The less central
      and wealthy an economic node is today, the greater the chance it will be
      even less central and wealthy tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The human impacts, and the impacts on the natural world of this extraction
      dynamic are catastrophic over the long term. Not only that, but though it
      may be beneficial in the short term for central nodes, this dynamic is
      constantly sapping the growth energy of the network as a whole through
      overcentralization. The reason we are trying to solve the problem of the
      distributed production of economic value is that distributed value
      creation creates a healthier network and more value for all nodes.
      Extractive centralization dynamics work against this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in an economically empty world, this extractive dynamic does not
      create systemic instabilities in the money network. When nodes have
      relatively easy access to natural resources (particularly cheap energy),
      they can create enough value to grow their own wealth and often pay the
      extractive "tax" of money so easily that it simply goes unnoticed in the
      mild inflation of smoothly functioning modern money economies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an economically full world, it's harder to create real value. When the
      ocean is full of fish and oil is cheap, an investment in a fishing vessel
      and a skilled crew is likely to bring a great return. When fish stocks are
      depleted and oil is expensive, the same investment brings far less return,
      or a loss. This same principle now applies across vast areas of our value
      producing economies. As a general rule, it used to take less money and
      less risk to harvest natural resources. They were cheaper when they were
      more abundant, and it costs more and requires more risk now that the
      easiest deposits and accumulations of natural capital are depleted and
      sometimes polluted. The longer we remain in sustainability overshoot, the
      generally scarcer and more expensive natural resources will become.
    </p>

    <h4>Misallocation of capital:</h4>
    <p>
      In a full world, rates of return drop on real investments and therefore
      speculative investment becomes more attractive to capital than investments
      that produce real value flows. Then the self-referential money math of
      balance sheet leverage takes over, and those speculative returns get coded
      into the money system itself as a sure thing on the balance sheets of
      other nodes. In this way, local risks to growth become systemic risks to
      stability, systemic risks are amplified, and capital is misdirected when
      we need it most. The "subprime" crisis of 2007 played out exactly on this
      dynamic. This is the underlying reason that modern money economies are
      becoming more and more based on a cycle of bubbles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subprime arose because of this dynamic, but it was only a trigger event
      for the release of a much larger build up of systemic instability than is
      captured by the term subprime. The systemic contagion following subprime
      is identified by Snider as eurodollar event #1. Something deep in the guts
      of modern money has never been the same since August 9, 2007.
    </p>

    <p>
      A full world is a challenge like nothing we've ever faced, and the problem
      with speculative investment bubbles is the misallocation of capital. A
      vast amount of financial, economic, natural, and human capital went into
      the housing bubble for example, and a lot of it just disappeared in the
      subprime crash and far, far more in the following economic dislocation. We
      need to unleash the full power of capital in radical new ways in order to
      solve the challenge of a full world. Capital that is lost to speculative
      investment crashes while we face this collective challenge that is rapidly
      turning into a crisis, is capital that has been wasted when we can least
      afford it.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2. Building economic resilience because modern money is systemically
      vulnerable to existing and looming changes in its environment
    </h3>

    <p>
      Money is a centrally controlled solution to a decentralized problem.
      Sovereigns, central banks, and global treaties lay down the base rules of
      the system. The money creation process is a series of cascading
      authorizations emanating from these nodes, allowing other nodes to use
      leverage to create money under the various math based conditions of the
      currency regime.
    </p>

    <p>
      This system is premised on the scarcity of money and the systemization of
      default risk. The reason that centralized controls are needed is that
      money economies take the default risk of specific nodes, leverage it up,
      and abstract it into a system-scale problem. Insolvency in a critical node
      does not affect just that node and its counterparties, it affects the very
      medium of exchange itself by removing water from the ocean of money.
    </p>

    <p>
      In modern money economies, money creation is merged into the process of
      leveraging capital. The debt and credit of money issuance mostly occurs
      during the process by which economic participants use banks to deploy
      capital to obtain anything from a house to a fishing boat to real estate
      to financial assets.
    </p>

    <p>
      In any economy, value is created in free exchange. In a money economy,
      money creation occurs in capital deployment. This fundamental misalignment
      between the creation of value and the creation of money disconnects
      money-based finance from value creation at the deepest level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern economies break on margin calls. A node or group of nodes can
      become system-critical if they become unable to provide the contracted
      value that appears on the balance sheets of other nodes, which has then
      been again money-leveraged to other nodes across the system. Margin
      calls on system critical nodes can crack modern money systems, and these
      ruptures damage our ability to build wealth with each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      These risk-repricing events do not have to be catastrophic to have
      significant impacts. The pattern since 2007 has been: dislocation,
      stabilization at a lower level, some growth but not back to prior levelsâ€¦
      then the next dislocation. These dislocations are usually not individually
      catastrophic, but the current pattern is one that degrades our ability to
      generate wealth together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most money economies have displayed a clear staircase decline pattern
      since August 9, 2007 when measured against their prior growth
      trajectories, and a systemic and self-reinforcing crisis is a real
      possibility in the future. It is simply unknown whether modern money will
      remain a low friction medium of exchange over the long term in a full,
      resource constrained world. Can growth in value be decoupled from growth
      in resource throughput? If real growth profiles change, can existing
      asset/liability chains be fulfilled without breaking the system on margin
      calls and a repricing of risk? Can money economies that were born in a
      grow-to-survive environment succeed in a full world, where
      preserve-to-survive is becoming the optimal strategy?
    </p>

    <h3>
      3. Financially aligning an economic network to produce maximum value
      within evolving limits of sustainability
    </h3>

    <p>
      Our solution uses market dynamics to establish prices for flows of
      resources and flows of wastes. When this principle is run through the
      money-paradigm war of capital vs legislation, we get carbon tax schemes
      that seem to benefit only the legislators and the pools of capital most
      involved in the creation of these schemes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Carbon taxes must be mentioned as an attempt to solve the problem of
      financially aligning an economic network to produce maximum value within
      evolving limits of sustainability. However, given the results, it is
      unclear if the actual motivation is solving this problem. Carbon taxes as
      they exist today solve a specific set of problems for certain nodes that
      are central to the money system. However, they do not appear to be
      particularly good solutions to the real economic or environmental problems
      that exist across the system.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Building widespread multigenerational wealth</h3>

    <p>
      Modern money has succeeded in building multigenerational wealth, but the
      results are not widespread. The extractive dynamics of money systems
      appear to limit their capacity to build long term wealth across a full
      network of economic participants.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Empowering human sovereignty</h3>

    <p>
      Money does not give us the power to create and control our own medium of exchange. Money does not give us the power to securely own and share our own data. Money does not enable us to sustainably consume natural resources.
