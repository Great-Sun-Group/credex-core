# Logging Best Practices

## General Guidelines

1. Use the `logger` object imported from `config/logger.ts` for all logging operations.
2. Avoid using `console.log()`, `console.error()`, or `console.warn()` directly in the code.
3. Choose the appropriate log level based on the importance and nature of the information being logged.

## Log Levels

- `logger.error()`: Use for errors that affect the application's functionality and require immediate attention.
- `logger.warn()`: Use for potentially harmful situations that don't prevent the application from functioning.
- `logger.info()`: Use for general information about the application's state and important operations.
- `logger.debug()`: Use for detailed information useful during development and troubleshooting.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent**: Use the same logging style and level of detail throughout the application.

2. **Include Context**: Always include relevant context with log messages, such as request IDs, user IDs, or other identifiers that can help in troubleshooting.

   ```typescript
   logger.info("User logged in", { userId: user.id, requestId: req.id });
   ```

3. **Avoid Sensitive Information**: Never log sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or personal data.

4. **Use Appropriate Log Levels**: Choose the log level that best matches the importance of the message.

5. **Log Errors Properly**: When logging errors, include the full error object or stack trace.

   ```typescript
   try {
     // Some operation
   } catch (error) {
     logger.error("Operation failed", { error });
   }
   ```

6. **Log at Service Boundaries**: Log incoming requests and outgoing responses at service boundaries to aid in debugging and monitoring.

7. **Use Structured Logging**: Use objects for additional context rather than string concatenation.

   ```typescript
   // Good
   logger.info("Processing order", { orderId: order.id, amount: order.amount });
   
   // Avoid
   logger.info(`Processing order ${order.id} with amount ${order.amount}`);
   ```

8. **Log Lifecycle Events**: Log application startup, shutdown, and other important lifecycle events.

9. **Be Mindful of Performance**: Avoid excessive logging, especially in high-traffic code paths. Use debug level for verbose logging that can be enabled when needed.

10. **Use Logger Namespaces**: If your logging library supports it, use namespaces to categorize logs from different parts of your application.

By following these best practices, we can maintain a consistent and effective logging strategy throughout our application, making it easier to monitor, debug, and maintain our codebase.
