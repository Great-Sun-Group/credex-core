    <section>
      <h2>Wealth and success in a full world</h2>
      <p>
        In an economically empty world, the ocean is full of fish. When capital is deployed to build, crew, and maintain fishing vessels, a real economic return is to be expected in the harvest of fish. In such an environment, economic systems that can deploy the greatest amount of capital to extract the greatest amount of resources at the greatest rate, succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The driving dynamic in an economically empty world can be expressed as: more capital equals more extraction of natural wealth equals more real wealth equals more capital. The ever-evolving fiat money systems of today were birthed and raised in an economically empty world, and in this world they outcompeted all alternatives because they deploy capital by fiat, without needing it to first accumulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fiat systems can deploy capital as debt instead of surplus, with the expectation that the deployed capital will be used to create real value to pay back the debt. In an economically empty world, this expectation is relatively easily fulfilled by the creation of real economic value by the deployed capital. But this return on fiat-deployed capital is often based ultimately on an unsustainable level of natural resource harvest. Instead of focusing on adding economic value to a fixed resource base, this kind of capital is focused on extracting as much economic value as possible from the natural world, as quickly as possible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The full world reality</h2>
      <p>
        But in an economically full world, there aren't as many fish in the sea, and capital deployed to build fishing vessels no longer creates the same kind of reliable real return. In an economically full world, this same dynamic is true across a vast number of domains, and yet the growth imperative built into the fiat systems compels and manipulates capital to extend beyond its natural, sustainable, life-giving growth impulse, and into unhealthy, forced speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speculative investment has to be leveraged into growth, a dynamic which in an economically empty world can be put to use creating real economic value. But in an economically full world, what once fueled real growth and enabled fiat to outcompete all alternatives, no longer reliably delivers real economic value like it once did. Instead of the strength it once was in an economically empty world, dependence on extracting ever greater economic value from nature has become a crippling liability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>System fragility</h2>
      <p>
        This is why, despite a few apparent booms, the fiat money economies have lived in a constant state of fragility since the 2007 crisis and ensuing crash. In an economically full world, the amount of growth-focused investment demanded by the fiat economies has nowhere to go, so forcibly invested capital is continually building up in the system as speculative excess. But forcing financial capital to act outside its nature disconnects it from the underlying economic reality, and so crashes are inevitable. A crash now seems to occur every time that reality re-asserts itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being vulnerable to reality is a fundamentally weak and brittle state for a system to exist in. The underlying reality is that infinite growth in resource consumption is an impossibility on a finite world, and fiat's strength in deploying leveraged capital for resource extraction has become a weakness in the economically full world of our times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credcoin is an alternative that is independent of this dynamic. Credcoin is an alternative grounded in sustainable harvest, not ever increasing extraction. We no longer live in a time when we need capital to innovate ways to extract more natural resources. Now is the time to put capital to work innovating ways to extract more value from the natural resources that we can realistically and sustainably consume.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credcoin creates an environment where capital can operate free of systemically-imposed constraints and pressures, innovating and growing naturally on the foundation of a sustainable resource harvest.
      </p>

      <h2>We orient on what we measure</h2>
      <p>
        The value of every asset is in constant fluctuation and dynamic relationship with the value of every other asset. Conceptually, implemented at scale, credcoin is the average in-situ (in their naturally occurring location) market value of the natural resources (specific assets) consumed by every human today. When we orient on CXX and the average value that it represents, rather than the value of a single specific asset such as money, we start to insulate ourselves from the vagaries of asset money and come into greater alignment with underlying economic realities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credcoin is a reference point that makes sense in a deeply human-centred and earth-centered way. One equal share of the natural wealth entering the organic economy is a primal, fundamental reference point.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Deep context</h2>
      <p>
        We orient ourselves by what we measure. When we orient ourselves by credcoin we are tuning into the most important fundamental economic reality on our Earth as of the present moment. Therefore, prices in credcoin provide a deep level of fully-contextualized information about our choices and their relationship to our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, since one credcoin is one equal share of the in-situ natural resources needed to sustain humanity, the amount that I have to pay daily in order to meet my basic needs is a precise representation and ratio of the amount of added value (over and above in-situ value) that the human economy adds to the natural resource harvest in order to meet these needs. The lower the price in credcoin to meet my basic needs, the more efficiently the market has operated to deliver the resources that I need, in the form that I need them, in the place that I am.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Daily rebalancing</h2>
      <p>
        The value of credcoin expresses the relationship between the two primary reference points of organic economic activity: the value of natural wealth entering the organic economy, and the number of humans who are consumers of that wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of these primary reference points are likely to change daily, and yet their actual present relationship to each other always remains of primary economic importance. The numbers of each value are secondary, their relationship is primary. 1.000 CXX is mathematically bound to the relationship between these values. 1.000 CXX is the mathematical expression of this relationship, around which all other ecosystem values orient.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Balancing the equation</h2>
      <p>
        By making the value expressed by the relationship primary, the DCO creates a balanced foundation out of two dynamic pillars. The DCO updates all numerical values in the ecosystem so that the inputs to the credcoin equation (G+M)/P solve to 1.000. Since we cannot retroactively change the number of participants (P), since we are given 1.000 as a fixed reference point by the credcoin equation, and since mathematically we have to change something to balance the equation, we change the credcoin values of G+M, and update all credcoin values across the ecosystem proportionally to this change.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to maintain allegiance to the contracted intentions of each counterparty, this is done without impacting the face value of any credex, except those denominated in credcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Values denominated in CXX have their numeric value updated daily, so that they remain true to the original contracted intentions as of the day of the contract. Because we can calculate the fluctuation in the value of CXX from one day to the next with full precision, we know what the value of yesterday's contracts are in relationship to today's CXX value. Updating these CXX contracts numerically keeps them true to their original intention, which is relative to one equal share of the value our economy harvested from nature on the day they were issued.
      </p>
    <p>
      The DCO anchors the multi-denominational accounting protocol of the credex ecosystem to constantly changing physical and economic reality in order to provide members a financial environment that mantains the congruency of our personal and corporate financial data by dynamically balancing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Local truth:</strong> preserving the value of our  contracts in their specified denomination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Global truth:</strong> preserving the value of our contracts relative to every other value expressed in any other denomination.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Past truth:</strong> preserving the value of our past contracts relative to today's real resource flow values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future truth:</strong> preserving the value of our current contracts independent of changing resource flow values.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Metacredcoin</h2>
      <p>
        The metacredcoin (MXX) denomination provides another conceptual anchorpoint from which we can see and measure the organic economy. One metacredcoin is the total value of the natural wealth entering the organic economy today. One metacredcoin is the total of the CXX values distributed in the DCO. Metacredcoin is the total of the gift and market portions of the credcoin equation.
      </p>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          G + M = 1.000 MXX
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        This being true, the full credcoin equation can also be expressed as:
      </p>
      <div class="equation-container">
        <div class="equation">
          <div class="fraction">
            <div class="numerator">1.000 MXX</div>
            <div class="denominator">P</div>
          </div>
          = 1.000 CXX
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Being linked to the DCO, metacredcoin adjusts out its own inflation in the same manner as credcoin. The relationships between the value of 1.000 MXX and 1.000 CXX today, and of each of these values to any previous day's values, contain layers of critical information about the full flow of real resources supporting the organic economy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Trivializing inflation</h2>
      <p>
        The unique properties of credcoin make it not subject to inflation in relationship to itself. But within the credex ecosystem, inflation was never a problem in the first place. When transacting and building wealth in the ecosystem, inflation can be solved in countless ways, chosen by counterparties themselves. If inflation is the main challenge being faced, credcoin may or may not be the ideal solution. It's up to counterparties to decide.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an environment of hyperinflation, economic participants are forced out of money. Keeping cash on your balance sheet is financial suicide. But economic participants are also forced out of using the numerical reference point of money. It is economically counterproductive to think in terms of currency-based numbers if the currency is hyperinflating around you. What matters is real relative values. How many loaves of bread is my time worth? How many litres of gas? Or maybe how much value relative to what I pay for accommodations? Those are the questions that always matter. Money gives us a shorthand and reference point, but when money destabilizes, it becomes clear that real relative value is ultimately what matters.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Economic reality</h2>
      <p>
        Financial systems must reflect economic realities if they are to survive and thrive. Much of what is commonly called inflation is becoming more and more about real economic shortages rather than monetary imbalances. Credex is a financial solution, and therefore cannot and should not be used in an attempt to alter economic realities. It is the job of the financial system to accurately reflect and report on real economic conditions and prices, so that the market can do its job. If fish are scarce, the price of fish will rise. This is not inflation that needs to be controlled, it is an economic signal that needs to be attended to in a real physical way, not through financial engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limits and timelags of increasing production have always been a factor in these kinds of resource price increases, and still are the driving factor in the many cases where natural resources are still readily available. But with increasing frequency, the driver of this kind of resource price increase is that in an economically full world, when the global economy accelerates past a certain threshold, scarcity dynamics start to play a role not just in terms of scarcity within the economy, but in terms of physical scarcity anywhere in the world. Cheap (easily accessible) oil is the most critical shortage for the global economy, but it is far from the only one.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The sustainability imperative</h2>
      <p>
        The sustainability imperative is crushing money economies by gradually lowering the wealth/growth threshold past which we see economically damaging increases in the price of raw resources, then of goods, then of services as the impacts pass through the value chains. But this is not monetary inflation, this is resource depletion that makes each resource more economically valuable, and that reality needs to be reflected in prices in order to be solved by markets closely involved in physical reality (for example via the DCO), and not manipulated by financial engineering or government fiat.
      </p>
      <p>
        This resource depletion threshold is the dynamic that if left to persist will eventually destroy modern money economies. The pressure for these systems to evolve since the 2007 crisis has been intense, and efforts have been made, but nothing is fundamentally different now than it was then. The main difference is that now we are further along the depletion curve for economically critical natural resources. This means that our financial tokens are likely at least as misvalued as they were in the lead up to that prior crisis. It will take the next crisis before we know exactly where and when reality will reassert itself, and how far finance has again become misaligned with real economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effort to integrate all economic activity into the organic economy is a massive one. As resources deplete and the flow that we can harvest into our economy shrinks, the challenge becomes greater. As we reverse this trend by limiting consumption, nurturing the biosphere, and innovating intently on a sustainable flow of resources, the challenge lessens.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are not challenges that can be solved in the financial realm. Real physical and economic changes are required. The work that needs to be done to align economic realities with environmental realities is urgent. Credcoin gives us the financial tools to align markets themselves behind the push to sustainability, but there is nothing that will immediately solve the very real overconsumption problems that plague modern money economies. And usually, the richer we are, the more we are contributing to the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Credcoin opens up new horizons of possibilities for wealth in harmony with nature and respecting every human, but like anything worth doing, it's going to take effort and sacrifice to achieve our goals. We are going to have to make more efficient use of natural resources, and nothing is more efficient than a well-designed market. The best way to make more efficient use of natural resources is to increase their price relative to the rest of economic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through its implementation of sovereign human rights in the DCO, credcoin distributes the resource premium we must pay equally to all, ensuring fairness and rewarding personal behaviours and business models that move us into long-term alignment with our biosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way we limit total consumption and ensure everyone gets their fair share, without limiting individual freedom to consume. Overconsumption by one person results in fewer real resources for others, but the market mechanism of the DCO ensure that financial resources are transfered from overconsumers to the rest in compensation, bringing even conspicuous consumption into line with foundational biological and social priorities.
