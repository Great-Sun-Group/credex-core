1. Implement dynamic Neo4j bolt URL management

   a. Modify terraform/main.tf:
   - Remove hardcoded Neo4j bolt URLs
   - Add outputs for Neo4j instance private IPs
   - Create AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store entries for Neo4j bolt URLs

   b. Update GitHub Actions workflows:
   - Add steps to retrieve Neo4j bolt URLs from Parameter Store
   - Pass bolt URLs as environment variables to the application

   c. Update application code:
   - Modify the application to use environment variables for Neo4j bolt URLs

2. Testing and validation:

   a. Test deployment to staging environment:
   - Push changes to stage branch
   - Verify that the workflow runs successfully
   - Check that both application and infrastructure are updated
   - Verify that Neo4j bolt URLs are correctly set and used

   b. Test deployment to production environment:
   - Push changes to prod branch
   - Verify that the workflow runs successfully
   - Check that both application and infrastructure are updated
   - Verify that Neo4j bolt URLs are correctly set and used

   c. Test deployment to development environment:
   - Manually trigger the development workflow
   - Verify that the workflow runs successfully
   - Check that a new development environment is created in AWS
   - Verify that Neo4j bolt URLs are correctly set and used

3. Final review and optimization:

   a. Review all changes and ensure they meet the project requirements
   b. Optimize workflows for efficiency and reliability
   c. Update any related scripts or tools to work with the new deployment process

## Note on AWS Credentials
We will continue to use AWS credentials in GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployments in each environment. These credentials will be securely stored as GitHub Secrets, following best practices for secret management in CI/CD pipelines.
